If you're considering [Convex](https://go.bitdoze.com/convex) for your real-time application backend, you might be wondering how the self-hosted option compares to the cloud-hosted free tier in terms of performance. I ran comprehensive load tests on both deployments to give you real numbers to work with.

In this article, I'll share detailed benchmark results comparing self-hosted Convex (with various CDN configurations) against the cloud-hosted version. These tests were conducted on a live application to give you realistic performance expectations.

## Test Setup and Methodology

### What We're Testing

I used [oha](https://www.bitdoze.com/oha-website-load-testing/), a modern HTTP load testing tool written in Rust, to benchmark the performance of different Convex deployment configurations. The tests measure how well each setup handles concurrent requests under load.

### Test Parameters

All tests were run with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Total Requests | 1,000 | Number of HTTP requests to send |
| Concurrent Connections | 500 | Simulated users accessing simultaneously |
| Rate Limit | 50 req/sec | Controlled request rate for consistency |

The command used:
```bash
oha -n 1000 -c 500 -q 50 https://target-url/
```

### What oha Measures

The oha load testing tool provides several key metrics:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of requests that completed successfully (HTTP 200)
- **Average Response Time**: Mean time from request to response
- **Response Time Distribution**: Percentile breakdown showing consistency
- **Throughput (Requests/sec)**: How many requests the server handles per second
- **DNS+dialup Time**: Connection establishment overhead

These metrics help understand both the raw performance and reliability under load.

## Test Configurations

I tested four different configurations:

1. **Self-Hosted (No CDN)**: Convex backend running on VPS, accessed directly
2. **Self-Hosted (Full CDN)**: CloudFlare CDN active for both website and Convex endpoints
3. **Self-Hosted (Site CDN Only)**: CloudFlare CDN for website, direct access to Convex
4. **Cloud Convex Free Tier**: Standard cloud-hosted Convex with CloudFlare on frontend

## Analysis and Insights

### Performance Comparison

The benchmark results reveal significant performance differences:

| Metric | Winner | Improvement vs Cloud |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Average Response Time | Self-Hosted + Full CDN | **11.75x faster** |
| Fastest Response | Self-Hosted + Full CDN | 2.6x faster |
| Consistency (99th percentile) | Self-Hosted + Full CDN | 13.4x better |
| Throughput | Self-Hosted + Full CDN | 12% higher |

### Why Self-Hosted Performs Better

Several factors contribute to the performance advantage:

<ListCheck>
- **Geographic Proximity**: Self-hosted server can be placed closer to your users
- **CDN Caching**: CloudFlare caches static assets and can optimize API responses
- **Dedicated Resources**: No shared infrastructure with other tenants
- **Network Path**: Shorter network hops when CDN is properly configured
- **SSL Termination**: CDN handles SSL at edge, reducing backend load
</ListCheck>

### The CDN Impact

The data clearly shows the impact of proper CDN configuration:

| Configuration | Avg Response | vs No CDN |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Full CDN (Site + API) | 0.16s | 6.1x faster |
| Site CDN Only | 0.63s | 1.6x faster |
| No CDN | 0.98s | baseline |

<Notice type="warning" title="CDN Configuration Matters">
Simply having a CDN isn't enough. The dramatic performance improvement comes from routing Convex API endpoints through the CDN as well, not just the static website assets.
</Notice>

### Data Transfer Comparison

| Configuration | Size/Request | Data/sec |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Self-Hosted (No CDN) | 128 KiB | 5.90 MiB |
| Self-Hosted (Full CDN) | 14.8 KiB | 736 KiB |
| Self-Hosted (Site CDN) | 17.6 KiB | 841 KiB |
| Cloud Convex | 17.6 KiB | 784 KiB |

The CDN configurations show compression benefits, reducing data transfer by ~88% compared to uncompressed responses.

## When to Choose Each Option

### Choose Self-Hosted + Full CDN When:

<ListCheck>
- Performance is critical for your application
- You have users in specific geographic regions
- You want predictable, consistent response times
- You're comfortable managing infrastructure
- You need to optimize for sub-200ms response times
</ListCheck>

### Choose Cloud Convex Free Tier When:

<ListCheck>
- You're prototyping or in development phase
- Your application has low traffic requirements
- You want zero infrastructure management
- Geographic distribution isn't a concern
- 1-2 second response times are acceptable
</ListCheck>

## Recommendations

Based on these benchmarks, here are my recommendations:

### For Production Applications

1. **Self-host Convex** on a VPS in the same region as your target users
2. **Use CloudFlare** (or similar CDN) for both website AND Convex endpoints
3. **Configure caching rules** appropriately for your API responses
4. **Monitor performance** regularly with tools like oha

### For Development/Staging

1. **Cloud Convex free tier** is perfectly adequate
2. Use self-hosted for performance testing before production
3. Keep development and production configurations similar

### Optimal Infrastructure Setup

| Component | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| VPS Provider | Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or AWS in user's region |
| VPS Specs | 4GB RAM minimum for PostgreSQL |
| CDN | CloudFlare (free tier works well) |
| Database | PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development |
| SSL | Let CDN handle SSL termination |

## Conclusion

The benchmark results clearly demonstrate that self-hosted Convex with proper CDN configuration significantly outperforms the cloud-hosted free tier in terms of response time and consistency. The self-hosted setup with full CDN achieved response times nearly **12x faster** than the cloud version.

However, performance isn't everything. The cloud-hosted option offers simplicity and zero maintenance overhead that may be more valuable during early development stages or for applications where sub-second response times aren't critical.

For production applications where performance matters, investing time in setting up self-hosted Convex with a proper CDN configuration will deliver substantial improvements in user experience.

## FAQ

<Accordion label="How do I run these benchmarks myself?" group="faq" expanded="true">
Install oha on your system:
- **Mac**: `brew install oha`
- **Linux**: `cargo install oha`
- **Windows**: `winget install hatoo.oha`

Then run:
```bash
oha -n 1000 -c 500 -q 50 https://your-convex-app-url/
```

Adjust the parameters based on your testing needs:
- `-n`: Total number of requests
- `-c`: Concurrent connections
- `-q`: Rate limit (requests per second)
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Will my results be similar?" group="faq">
Results will vary based on:
- **Geographic distance** between you, CDN edges, and servers
- **Server specifications** (CPU, RAM, network)
- **Database choice** (PostgreSQL vs SQLite)
- **CDN configuration** and caching rules
- **Application complexity** and data being fetched

Run your own benchmarks to get accurate numbers for your specific setup.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Is CloudFlare necessary for good performance?" group="faq">
While CloudFlare isn't strictly necessary, a CDN provides significant benefits:
- SSL termination at edge locations
- Geographic distribution of content
- DDoS protection
- Compression and optimization

CloudFlare's free tier is sufficient for most self-hosted Convex deployments. Alternatives like Fastly, AWS CloudFront, or Bunny.net work equally well.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="What about the cost difference?" group="faq">
**Cloud Convex Free Tier:**
- Free for up to 1M function calls/month
- 1GB storage included
- No infrastructure costs

**Self-Hosted Convex:**
- VPS: ~$8-20/month (Hetzner, DigitalOcean)
- Domain: ~$1/month
- CloudFlare: Free tier sufficient
- **Total**: ~$10-25/month

Self-hosting becomes cost-effective when you exceed the free tier limits or need better performance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Does self-hosting affect real-time sync performance?" group="faq">
Real-time synchronization works identically in both deployments. The benchmark tests measure HTTP request/response performance, which affects:
- Initial page loads
- Data fetching
- Function calls

WebSocket-based real-time updates have different characteristics and weren't specifically tested here, though they benefit from the same geographic proximity advantages.
