## What is Amp Code?

Amp is a frontier coding agent built by [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/) that brings AI assistance directly into your development workflow. Unlike simple code completion tools, Amp is designed as a true agent that can understand your entire codebase, execute commands, edit files, and work autonomously on complex tasks.

### Core Principles

Amp is built around four key principles that make it different from other AI coding tools:

<ListCheck>

- **Unconstrained token usage**: No artificial limits on context or output. If your task needs millions of tokens, Amp uses them.
- **Always the best models**: You don't pick models—Amp automatically uses the most capable models available (currently Claude Sonnet 4.5).
- **Raw model power**: Direct access to what frontier models can actually do, not watered-down versions.
- **Built to evolve**: Automatically stays current with the best models as they're released.

</ListCheck>

## Amp Free vs Smart Mode

Amp offers two distinct modes to fit different needs and budgets:

### Amp Free Mode

Amp Free is completely free of charge, supported by ads and training data sharing. It uses a mix of top open-source models, frontier models with limited context windows, and pre-release models in testing.

**Key Features:**

<ListCheck>

- **Completely free** to use for work or personal projects
- **Unlimited usage** (some rate limits apply)
- **Ad-supported** with tasteful developer-focused advertisements
- **Training data sharing** required (models train on your usage)
- **Interactive use** in editor or CLI
- **Not available** for enterprise workspaces

</ListCheck>

<Notice type="warning" title="Training Data Requirement">

To make Amp Free sustainable, your code and conversations are used to train models. If you're working with proprietary code or don't want this, use Amp Smart mode instead.

</Notice>

### Amp Smart Mode (Paid)

Smart mode is Amp's default paid tier that offers the full frontier model experience with unconstrained usage.

**Key Features:**

<ListCheck>

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** with up to 1 million token context
- **Unconstrained token usage** for complex tasks
- **No training data sharing** (zero data retention available for Enterprise)
- **Oracle access** (GPT-5 for complex reasoning)
- **Subagents** for parallel task execution
- **Custom tools** via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

</ListCheck>

**Pricing:**

- Pay-as-you-go based on actual model usage
- Direct pass-through of API costs with no markup
- Most users get $10 USD in free credits to start
- Workspace credits pool usage across team members

| Mode | Cost | Models | Training | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Free** | $0 | Mixed OSS + Frontier | Required | Learning, personal projects |
| **Smart** | Pay-as-you-go | Claude 4.5, GPT-5 | Optional | Professional development |
| **Enterprise** | 50% markup | Best available | Never | Teams, proprietary code |

## Amp IDE Extension: VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf

The Amp IDE extension integrates directly into your code editor, providing a seamless AI assistant experience. It works with VS Code and compatible forks like Cursor and Windsurf.

### Installation

Installing Amp in your IDE is straightforward:

**For VS Code:**
1. Visit [ampcode.com](https://ampcode.com/) and sign in
2. Install the [Amp extension from VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.amp)
3. Authenticate with your Amp account
4. Start coding with AI assistance

**For Cursor or Windsurf:**
The same extension works in these VS Code-compatible editors. Follow the installation instructions on the Amp dashboard.

### Key Features in the IDE

<Accordion label="Thread Management" group="features">

Amp organizes conversations as **threads**—think of them like Git branches for AI conversations. Each thread maintains its own context, file changes, and conversation history.

- **Create new threads** for different tasks or features
- **Switch between threads** to work on multiple things
- **Share threads** with your team (if in a workspace)
- **Track file changes** made by the agent
- **Revert changes** individually or all at once

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="AGENTS.md Files" group="features">

Amp automatically looks for `AGENTS.md` files in your project to understand:

- Build and test commands
- Architecture and conventions
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- How to run and review code

Place `AGENTS.md` in your project root or subdirectories. Amp includes them automatically when working in those areas. You can also use `$HOME/.config/AGENTS.md` for personal preferences.

Example `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
# Project Guide for AI Agents

## Commands
- **dev**: `npm run dev`
- **build**: `npm run build`
- **test**: `npm test`

## Architecture
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Node.js + Express backend
- PostgreSQL database

## Important Notes
- Always run tests before committing
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing code patterns
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Context Management" group="features">

Amp tracks your context window usage and provides tools to manage it:

- **Hover over context indicator** to see which files are loaded
- **Compact Thread** to summarize and reduce context usage
- **New Thread with Summary** for fresh start with context carryover
- **File Changes view** shows what the agent modified
- View `AGENTS.md` files currently in use with `/agent-files`

</Accordion>

### Practical Example: Building with Amp

Here's how a typical Amp workflow looks in your IDE:

```
You: "Fix all the TypeScript errors in this file"

Amp:
- Reads the file and diagnostics
- Identifies the type errors
- Fixes each error with proper types
- Runs TypeScript compiler to verify
- Shows you the changes made
```

Or for more complex tasks:

```
You: "Look at localhost:3000 and make the header more minimal"

Amp:
- Takes a screenshot of the localhost URL
- Analyzes the current header design
- Suggests improvements
- Modifies the CSS/components
- Takes another screenshot to verify
- Iterates until it looks right
```

<Notice type="info" title="Pro Tip">

Use `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to submit messages in Amp. This deliberate action encourages you to write better prompts and get better results.

</Notice>

## Amp CLI: Terminal-Based AI Assistant

The Amp CLI brings AI coding assistance directly to your terminal—perfect for developers who live in the command line or need to integrate AI into scripts and workflows.

### Installation

Installing the CLI is simple:

```bash
# Using the install script (Linux, macOS, WSL)
curl -fsSL https://ampcode.com/install.sh | bash

# Or using npm
npm install -g @sourcegraph/amp

# Or using pnpm
pnpm add -g @sourcegraph/amp

# Or using Yarn
yarn global add @sourcegraph/amp
```

### Interactive Mode

Run `amp` without arguments for interactive mode:

```bash
$ amp
# Will prompt for login on first run
# Then start an interactive session
```

You can pipe input to start with context:

```bash
$ echo "commit all my changes" | amp
```

### Execute Mode

Use `-x` or `--execute` for non-interactive mode (requires paid credits):

```bash
$ amp -x "what files in this folder are markdown files?"
README.md
AGENTS.md
docs/getting-started.md
```

Combine with pipes for powerful workflows:

```bash
$ cat package.json | amp -x "what package manager is used?"
npm

$ git diff | amp -x "write a commit message for these changes"
fix: resolve TypeScript errors in authentication module
```

### Slash Commands

The CLI supports powerful slash commands:

<Tabs>
<Tab name="Basic Commands">

- `/help` - Show help and hotkeys
- `/new` - Start a new thread
- `/continue` - Continue an existing thread
- `/quit` - Exit Amp

</Tab>
<Tab name="Project Commands">

- `/generate-agent-file` - Create AGENTS.md for your project
- `/agent-files` - List AGENTS.md files in use
- `/permissions` - Edit permission rules
- `/compact` - Reduce context usage

</Tab>
<Tab name="Advanced">

- `/queue [message]` - Queue message for later
- `/dequeue` - Restore queued messages
- `/editor` - Open $EDITOR to write prompt

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Custom Slash Commands

Create your own slash commands by adding scripts to `.agents/commands` or `~/.config/amp/commands`:

**Markdown files** become prompt templates:
```bash
# .agents/commands/pr-review.md becomes /pr-review
```

**Executables** run and send output to Amp:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ~/.config/amp/commands/outline
# Becomes /outline command

tree -L 2 "$@"
```

### Shell Mode

Execute shell commands directly in the CLI:

```bash
# Regular shell mode (included in context)
.ls -la

# Incognito mode (not included in context)
$pwd
```

### IDE Integration

The CLI can connect directly to your IDE:

```bash
# For VS Code or Neovim with Amp installed
$ amp --ide

# For JetBrains IDEs
$ amp --jetbrains
```

This gives Amp access to:
- Currently open files
- Selected code
- IDE diagnostics
- Direct file editing with undo support

## Advanced Features

### Oracle: Second Opinion from GPT-5

Amp includes access to a powerful "Oracle" tool that uses GPT-5 for complex reasoning and analysis. While Claude Sonnet 4.5 is great for day-to-day coding, sometimes you need deeper analysis.

**Example usage:**

```
"Use the oracle to review the last commit's changes. I want to make sure
the actual logic hasn't changed, only the implementation."
```

```
"Analyze how these two functions work, then ask the oracle to figure out
how we can refactor the duplication while keeping it backwards compatible."
```

The main agent decides autonomously when to consult the oracle, but you can explicitly request it for better results on complex problems.

### Subagents for Parallel Work

Amp can spawn subagents to work on independent tasks in parallel. Each subagent has its own context window and can use tools like file editing and terminal commands.

**When to use subagents:**

<ListCheck>

- Converting multiple files to a new pattern (e.g., CSS to Tailwind)
- Running tests and fixing failures across different modules
- Independent feature implementations
- Tasks with extensive output you don't need in main context

</ListCheck>

**Example:**

```
"Use 3 subagents to convert these CSS files to Tailwind. One subagent per file."
```

Each subagent works independently and reports back when done, keeping your main thread clean and focused.

### Custom Tools with MCP

Amp supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for adding custom tools. Configure MCP servers in your settings:

```json
"amp.mcpServers": {
  "playwright": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless"]
  },
  "linear": {
    "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"
  }
}
```

This lets Amp interact with external services, APIs, and tools specific to your workflow.

### Amp Tab: AI-Powered Completions

Amp Tab is an experimental completion engine that anticipates your next actions:

- Multi-line code suggestions
- Edits in other files based on context
- Semantic understanding of your changes
- Language server diagnostics integration

Enable in settings: `"amp.tab.enabled": true`

Press `Tab` to accept suggestions and jump to additional edits.
