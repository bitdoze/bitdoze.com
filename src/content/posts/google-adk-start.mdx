Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are transforming the way we interact with technology, acting as autonomous assistants capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks. From virtual helpers to complex multi-agent systems, the demand for accessible tools to build these agents is on the rise. Enter Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), an open-source Python framework launched on April 9, 2025, designed to simplify the creation of sophisticated AI agents. Integrated tightly with the Google ecosystem—particularly Gemini models and Vertex AI—ADK empowers developers to build, test, and deploy agents with ease, whether for simple tasks or intricate collaborative workflows.

This article will guide you step-by-step through building your very first agent using ADK. We'll cover setting up your development environment using the fast package installer uv, connecting your agent to a Gemini model via the Google AI Studio API, giving your agent the ability to remember information using Session State, and enhancing it with real-time web search capabilities through the Tavily search tool. By the end, you'll have a functional agent ready for further exploration!

## What is the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)?

The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source Python framework introduced by Google on April 9, 2025, aimed at simplifying the development of AI agents. Built with integration in mind, ADK leverages Google’s powerful AI infrastructure—such as the Gemini family of models and Vertex AI—to enable developers to create agents that can reason, use tools, and collaborate in multi-agent systems. Whether you're building a single-purpose assistant or a team of specialized agents, ADK provides the scaffolding to make it happen efficiently.

### Key Features of ADK
- **Tool Integration**: Agents can call external APIs, perform web searches, or execute custom functions, making them versatile problem-solvers.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: ADK supports the creation of agent teams that work together, sharing tasks and memory for complex workflows.
- **Google Ecosystem Compatibility**: Seamless integration with Google Cloud, Vertex AI, and Gemini models ensures high performance and scalability.
- **Open-Source Flexibility**: Being open-source, ADK allows customization and community contributions, fostering rapid innovation.
- **Ease of Use**: With pre-built templates and a straightforward API, even beginners can get started quickly.

### Why Use ADK for Building Agents?
ADK stands out in a crowded field of AI development tools due to its balance of simplicity and power. Unlike more generic frameworks, its tight integration with Google’s AI offerings—like Gemini’s advanced reasoning capabilities—gives developers access to cutting-edge technology without needing to build everything from scratch. Additionally, its open-source nature means you’re not locked into a proprietary system, offering freedom to adapt your agent to unique use cases. Whether you’re automating a personal task or prototyping a business solution, ADK provides a robust starting point.

In short, ADK is ideal for anyone looking to harness AI agents without getting bogged down in complexity. It’s a bridge between powerful AI models and practical, real-world applications—perfect for your first agent-building adventure.

### Prerequisites

Before we dive into building your first agent with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and `uv`, let’s ensure you have everything you need to follow along. This section outlines the tools, accounts, and basic knowledge required to complete the project.

#### Required Tools and Accounts

1. **Python 3.9+**
   - ADK requires Python 3.9 or higher. We’ll use `uv` to manage the Python version, so you don’t need it pre-installed—`uv` can handle that for you. However, having a base Python installation (e.g., via your system package manager or [python.org](https://www.python.org)) simplifies the initial `uv` setup.

2. **uv**
   - The star of our project management show! You’ll install `uv` as a standalone binary (no Python required upfront). We’ll cover the installation steps in the next section.

3. **Google AI Studio API Key**
   - To power our agent with the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, you’ll need an API key from Google AI Studio. Sign up or log in at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com), navigate to the API section, and generate a key. We’ll configure it securely using environment variables.

4. **Tavily API Key**
   - For search functionality, we’ll integrate the Tavily search tool, which provides real-time web search results tailored for AI agents. Get a free API key by signing up at [tavily.com](https://tavily.com). You’ll need this to enable your agent to fetch information from the web.

5. **Text Editor or IDE**
   - Use any editor you prefer—VS Code, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor like Notepad++ will work. You’ll be writing Python code and editing configuration files.

#### Basic Knowledge Assumptions

This guide assumes you have:
- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python syntax, functions, and running scripts. You don’t need to be an expert, but you should know how to write and execute a simple Python program.
- **Understanding of Virtual Environments**: A general idea of why virtual environments are useful (isolating project dependencies). If you’ve used `venv` or `pip` before, you’re set.
- **API Basics**: Awareness of what an API key is and how it’s used to authenticate requests. No deep API expertise is required—we’ll walk through the setup.

With these in place, you’re ready to set up your project and start building. In the next section, we’ll install `uv`, initialize your project, and add the necessary dependencies to get ADK up and running.


### Setting Up Your Project with uv

Now that you have the prerequisites sorted, let’s set up your Python project using `uv`. This section walks you through installing `uv`, initializing a new project, creating a virtual environment, and adding the necessary dependencies for the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Tavily search integration. By using `uv` instead of `pip`, you’ll experience a faster, more streamlined workflow.

#### Installing uv

`uv` is a standalone tool written in Rust, so you don’t need a pre-existing Python installation to get started. As of April 2025, the latest version is available from the Astral team’s official site. Here’s how to install it:

- **On macOS/Linux**:
  Open your terminal and run:
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
  This downloads and installs `uv` into `~/.local/bin`. After installation, ensure it’s in your PATH by restarting your terminal or running:
  ```bash
  source ~/.local/bin/env
  ```

- **On Windows**:
  In PowerShell, execute:
  ```powershell
  irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
  ```
  The installer adds `uv` to your PATH automatically, but you might need to restart PowerShell to use it.

Verify the installation:
```bash
uv --version
```
You should see output like `uv 0.6.6` (or a later version by April 2025). If it fails, check your PATH or reinstall.

#### Initializing a New Python Project

With `uv` installed, let’s create a new project:

1. **Initialize the Project**:
   Run:
   ```bash
   uv init my-adk-agent
   cd my-adk-agent
   ```
   This creates a directory `my-adk-agent` with a basic structure:
   ```
   my-adk-agent/
   ├── .python-version  # Pins Python version (e.g., "3.12")
   ├── main.py         # Starter script
   ├── pyproject.toml  # Project configuration
   └── README.md       # Project documentation
   ```
   The `pyproject.toml` file is pre-populated with minimal metadata:
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "my-adk-agent"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "Add your description here"
   readme = "README.md"
   requires-python = ">=3.12"
   dependencies = []
   ```

2. **Set the Python Version**:
   The default Python version in `.python-version` (e.g., 3.12) works for ADK, but let’s ensure we’re using 3.12 explicitly:
   ```bash
   uv python pin 3.12
   ```
   If 3.12 isn’t installed, `uv` can fetch it:
   ```bash
   uv python install 3.12
   ```

#### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Unlike `pip` and `venv`, `uv` simplifies environment creation:
```bash
uv venv
```
This creates a `.venv` directory in your project root using Python 3.12. You’ll see:
```
Using Python 3.12.x
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```
You can activate it manually if needed (`source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux, `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows), but `uv run` will handle this automatically later.

#### Adding ADK and Dependencies

Now, let’s add the ADK package and Tavily support:

1. **Add Google ADK**:
   ```bash
   uv add google-adk
   ```
   This updates `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [project]
   dependencies = [
       "google-adk>=x.x.x",  # Latest version as of April 2025
   ]
   ```

2. **Add Tavily Support**:
   Since we’ll use Tavily via LangChain’s integration, install `langchain-community` and `tavily-python`:
   ```bash
   uv add langchain-community tavily-python
   ```
   The `pyproject.toml` now includes:
   ```toml
   [project]
   dependencies = [
       "google-adk>=x.x.x",
       "langchain-community>=x.x.x",
       "tavily-python>=x.x.x",
   ]
   ```

3. **Sync the Environment**:
   Install all dependencies into `.venv`:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   You’ll see output listing installed packages (e.g., `google-adk`, `langchain-community`, `tavily-python`, and their dependencies) in mere milliseconds—`uv`’s speed shines here compared to `pip`.

Your project is now set up with `uv`, ready to build an ADK agent. In the next section, we’ll configure the Google AI Studio API to power our agent with the Gemini model.

Okay, here is the next section:

### Connecting to Gemini via AI Studio

Your ADK agent needs a way to communicate with the Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) that powers its intelligence. This communication happens via secure API calls, which require authentication credentials, typically an API key. Without a valid key, the LLM service will deny the agent's requests, preventing it from working.

For development and prototyping, Google AI Studio provides an easy way to get an API key.

**Get Your API Key**

1.  Go to the [Google AI Studio website](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2.  If you don't have one already, create an API key. Copy this key securely – you'll need it in the next step.

**Configure Your Environment**

The best way to provide the API key to your ADK application is through environment variables, commonly managed using a `.env` file within your project directory.

1.  Inside your agent project folder (the one containing your `agent.py` file), create a new file named `.env`.
2.  Open the `.env` file and add the following lines, replacing `"PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"` with the key you copied from AI Studio:

    ```dotenv
    # Use Google AI Studio (not Vertex AI)
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="False"

    # Your API Key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

The `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI="False"` line explicitly tells ADK to use the Google AI backend (which uses the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) instead of the Vertex AI backend. ADK will automatically load these variables when your agent runs, allowing it to authenticate securely with the Gemini API.



Okay, here is the next section:

### Building Your First Basic Agent

With the environment set up and the API key configured, let's create the core of our agent application.

**Set Up the Project Structure**

A recommended structure helps keep your agent code organized. In your main project directory (where you created the `.venv` folder), create a structure like this:

```
google-adk/
├── agent_module/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent.py
├── .venv/
└── .env
```

1.  Create a folder named `agent_module`. This will hold your agent's code.
2.  Inside `agent_module`, create an empty file named `__init__.py`. This tells Python to treat the folder as a package. Add the following line to it:
    ```python
    # agent_module/__init__.py
    from . import agent
    ```
3.  Inside `agent_module`, create the main file for your agent's logic: `agent.py`.
4.  You should already have the `.env` file in the `your_agent_project` directory from the previous step.

**Define Your Agent**

Now, open `agent.py` and define your first agent using the `Agent` class from ADK. This class is the central piece for defining your agent's identity, model, and instructions.

```python
# agent_module/agent.py
from google.adk.agents import Agent

# Define the root agent for your application
root_agent = Agent(
    # A unique name for your agent [cite: 167, 639]
    name="my_first_adk_agent",

    # Specify the Gemini model to use (ensure compatibility with AI Studio key) [cite: 19, 56, 168, 645]
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp", # Or "gemini-1.0-pro" etc.

    # A brief description of what the agent does [cite: 169, 642]
    description="A basic agent that can chat.",

    # Instructions guiding the agent's behavior and persona [cite: 171, 648]
    instruction="You are a friendly and helpful assistant. Respond concisely to user queries.",

    # Initially, we won't add specific tools [cite: 172, 659]
    tools=[]
)

print(f"Agent '{root_agent.name}' defined.")
```

In this code:
* `name`: Gives your agent a unique ID.
* `model`: Tells the agent which Gemini model to use for thinking and responding. We're using a recent Flash model suitable for general chat.
* `description`: Briefly summarizes the agent's purpose, which is especially useful in multi-agent setups.
* `instruction`: Provides the core guidance to the LLM on how it should behave.
* `tools`: An empty list for now, as this basic agent won't use external tools yet.

**Running Your Agent (Briefly)**

ADK provides command-line tools to interact with your agent. Navigate your terminal to the `your_agent_project` directory (the one containing `agent_module` and `.env`) and you can try:

* `adk web`: This launches an interactive web UI in your browser, allowing you to chat with your agent.
* `adk run agent_module`: This lets you chat with the agent directly in your terminal.

We won't delve deep into running the agent just yet, as we first need to add memory and tools, but this gives you an idea of how to interact with it later.



### Adding Memory with Session State

Our basic agent can chat, but it has no memory. Each time you interact with it, it starts fresh, forgetting everything from previous turns. To build more engaging and useful agents, we need to give them the ability to remember context and past interactions. ADK achieves this through **Session State**.

**What is Session State?**

Session State is essentially a memory bank for each individual conversation session. Technically, it's a Python dictionary associated with a specific user session. Information stored in this dictionary persists across multiple turns within that single conversation. Both your agent and its tools can read from and write to this state, allowing them to:

* Remember user preferences.
* Recall information mentioned earlier in the conversation.
* Personalize responses based on past interactions.

**Using `InMemorySessionService`**

For this tutorial, we'll use ADK's `InMemorySessionService`. As the name suggests, it stores the session history and state directly in your computer's memory. This is perfect for development and testing, though the memory will be lost when your application stops.

**Setting Up the Runner and Session Service**

To manage sessions and run your agent, you need two more components: `InMemorySessionService` and `Runner`. Let's add the setup code, typically in a main script or alongside your agent definition:

```python
# Add these imports to your agent.py or a main script
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.agents import Agent # Assuming root_agent is defined as before

# Define constants for the app and session identification
APP_NAME = "my_first_adk_app"
USER_ID = "user_test_1" # Identifier for the user
SESSION_ID = "session_abc_123" # Identifier for this specific conversation

# 1. Create the Session Service instance
session_service = InMemorySessionService()
print("Session Service created.")

# 2. Create the specific session (can initialize state here if needed)
session = session_service.create_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    user_id=USER_ID,
    session_id=SESSION_ID
    # state={"initial_key": "initial_value"} # Optional: initial state
)
print(f"Session '{SESSION_ID}' created.")

# 3. Create the Runner instance
# The Runner orchestrates the agent's execution and uses the session service
runner = Runner(
    agent=root_agent, # Your agent defined earlier
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    session_service=session_service
)
print(f"Runner created for agent '{root_agent.name}'.")

# (You would then use 'runner.run()' or 'runner.run_async()' to interact)
```

**Accessing State in Tools**

The primary way tools interact with memory is through the `ToolContext` object. If you define a tool function that accepts `tool_context: ToolContext` as its last argument, ADK automatically provides this object when the tool is called.

```python
# Example tool demonstrating state access
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext

def remember_something(data_to_remember: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    """Reads previous data from state and saves new data."""
    print("--- Tool: remember_something called ---")

    # Read from state (use .get() for safety)
    previous_data = tool_context.state.get("user_data", "nothing")
    print(f"--- Tool: Found previous data: '{previous_data}' ---") #

    # Write new data to state
    tool_context.state["user_data"] = data_to_remember # [cite: 354]
    print(f"--- Tool: Saved new data: '{data_to_remember}' ---")

    return {"status": "success", "message": f"I remembered '{data_to_remember}'. Before that, I knew about '{previous_data}'."}

# (You would add 'remember_something' to the agent's 'tools' list)
```

This allows tools to dynamically adapt their behavior based on what's happened earlier in the conversation.

**Quick Note on `output_key`:** ADK also offers a shortcut. By setting `output_key="some_name"` when defining an `Agent`, the agent's final text response for each turn will automatically be saved into `session.state["some_name"]`.

Now that our agent has a way to remember things, let's give it some tools to interact with the outside world!


### Enhancing Your Agent with Tools: Tavily Search

Our agent can now chat and remember things within a session. However, its knowledge is limited to what the underlying Gemini model was trained on. To make it truly powerful, we need to give it access to real-time information and external capabilities. In ADK, this is done using **Tools**.

Tools are functions or services that allow your agent to interact with the outside world – fetch data from APIs, query databases, perform calculations, or, as we'll do now, search the web.

**Integrating Third-Party Tools: LangChain & Tavily**

ADK is designed to be extensible and plays well with other popular AI frameworks. We can easily integrate tools built for libraries like LangChain. We'll use ADK's `LangchainTool` wrapper to incorporate the Tavily search API, a service designed specifically for AI agents to get up-to-date search results.

**Setup for Tavily**

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Add the necessary LangChain and Tavily libraries using `uv`:
    ```bash
    # Run this in your activated virtual environment
    uv add langchain_community tavily-python
    ```

2.  **Get Tavily API Key:**
    * Sign up for a free API key at the [Tavily website](https://tavily.com/).
    * Add this key to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        # .env file content (add this line)
        TAVILY_API_KEY="PASTE_YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        Make sure your application loads environment variables from this file (ADK often does this automatically, or you can use a library like `python-dotenv`).

**Using the `LangchainTool` Wrapper**

Now, let's integrate Tavily into our agent code:

1.  **Import necessary classes** in your `agent.py`:
    ```python
    # Add these imports
    from google.adk.tools.langchain_tool import LangchainTool
    from langchain_community.tools import TavilySearchResults
    import os # To potentially check for the API key
    ```

2.  **Instantiate and Wrap the Tool:** Create an instance of the LangChain tool and wrap it for ADK:
    ```python
    # Instantiate the LangChain Tavily tool
    # You can configure options like max_results
    tavily_search_tool_instance = TavilySearchResults(
        max_results=3,
        include_answer=True # Ask Tavily to provide a direct answer if possible
    )

    # Wrap it with ADK's LangchainTool
    adk_tavily_tool = LangchainTool(tool=tavily_search_tool_instance)

    print("Tavily search tool wrapped for ADK.")
    ```

**Update Your Agent Definition**

Finally, modify your agent definition to include the new tool and update its instructions so it knows when to use it:

```python
# Modify your existing root_agent definition in agent.py

root_agent = Agent(
    name="my_first_adk_agent", # Or maybe rename to "research_agent"
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
    description="A helpful assistant that can search the web for current information.",
    instruction="""You are a friendly and helpful assistant.
If the user asks for information that might require up-to-date details, recent events, or searching the web, use the 'TavilySearchResults' tool.
Otherwise, answer directly based on your knowledge.
Remember information provided earlier in the conversation using session state.""", # Added mention of memory

    # Add the wrapped Tavily tool to the list
    tools=[adk_tavily_tool] # Add any other tools like 'remember_something' here too if desired
)

print(f"Agent '{root_agent.name}' updated with Tavily tool.")

# Ensure your Runner is using this updated 'root_agent' instance
runner = Runner(
    agent=root_agent, # Make sure this uses the updated agent
    app_name=APP_NAME,
    session_service=session_service
)
```

Now, when you run your agent and ask a question requiring current information (e.g., "What's the latest news about AI agents?" or "What's the weather in London right now?"), the agent, guided by its instructions, should recognize the need to use the `TavilySearchResults` tool to fetch and provide a relevant, up-to-date answer.

### Run in terminal
You can use terminal to run the tool, with:

```sh
uv run python -m agent_module.agent
```

This will provide something like:

```sh
Tavily search tool wrapped for ADK.
Agent 'my_adk_agent_with_tools' defined with tools.
Session Service created.
Session 'session_main_1' created.
Runner created for agent 'my_adk_agent_with_tools'.
<frozen runpy>:128: RuntimeWarning: 'agent_module.agent' found in sys.modules after import of package 'agent_module', but prior to execution of 'agent_module.agent'; this may result in unpredictable behaviour

## Conclusion

Congratulations\! You've successfully built your first AI agent using the Google Agent Development Kit. We've walked through the essential steps:

  * **Setting up** your development environment using `uv` for package management.
  * **Connecting** your agent to the powerful Gemini models via a Google AI Studio API key.
  * **Defining** a basic agent structure with its core identity and instructions.
  * **Adding memory** using Session State, enabling contextual conversations.
  * **Integrating** a third-party tool (Tavily Search) using ADK's wrappers, giving your agent access to real-time web information.

This journey demonstrates the flexibility and power of ADK. You've seen how quickly you can get a basic agent running and how easily you can enhance it with memory and external tools. ADK provides the building blocks for everything from simple bots to complex, multi-agent systems capable of sophisticated orchestration and leveraging a rich tool ecosystem.

**Where to Go Next?**

Your first agent is just the beginning\! Here are some ideas to continue your exploration of ADK:

  * **Explore the Tutorials:** Dive deeper into concepts like multi-agent delegation, advanced state management, and safety callbacks by following the official ADK tutorials.
  * **Integrate Real APIs:** Replace mock data or simple tools with real-world APIs for weather, finance, or other services.
  * **Add More Tools:** Experiment with other built-in tools like Code Execution or Vertex AI Search, or integrate more tools from LangChain or CrewAi.
  * **Build Agent Teams:** Design systems with multiple specialized agents collaborating on tasks .
  * **Persistent Memory:** Investigate storing session state more permanently using databases instead of just in memory.
  * **Check out Samples:** Look at the [ADK Sample Agents](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://github.com/google/adk-samples) for more examples.

The [official ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)  is your comprehensive resource for all features, API references, and advanced guides.

You now have a solid foundation for building intelligent, capable agents with the Google Agent Development Kit. Happy building\!
