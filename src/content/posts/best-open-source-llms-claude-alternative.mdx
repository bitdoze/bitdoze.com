Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.6 works well for coding, but it's expensive. Plenty of developers are looking for alternatives that don't cost as much. The open source AI space has grown a lot since 2025, and now there are models that can do what Claude does for much less money.

This guide covers five open source models that can replace Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.6 for coding: GLM-5, Kimi K2.5, Qwen-Max, MiniMax M2.5, and Devstral 2. These models handle reasoning, code generation, and agent tasks well, and they cost significantly less than Claude.

<Notice type="info" title="Cost Comparison Overview">

While Claude Sonnet 4.5 costs $3-15 per million tokens, these open source alternatives range from $0.15 to $1.20 per million input tokens, offering savings of up to 95%.

</Notice>

## Why Consider Open Source LLM Alternatives?

Open source models have improved a lot and can compete with proprietary options. Here's why they're worth considering:

<ListCheck>

- **Cost Efficiency**: API costs are much lower than proprietary models
- **Transparency**: Open source code lets you understand and modify the model
- **Performance Parity**: Many open source models match or beat Claude Sonnet 4.5 on various tasks
- **Flexibility**: You can self-host or use various API providers
- **Community Support**: Active development teams keep improving the models

</ListCheck>

### Key Performance Areas to Consider

When evaluating LLM alternatives, several factors matter:

- **Coding Capabilities**: How well the model generates, debugs, and explains code
- **Reasoning Performance**: How well it handles complex problems and logical thinking
- **Context Length**: How much information the model can process at once
- **Agentic Tasks**: Tool usage, function calling, and multi-step task execution
- **Cost-Performance Ratio**: How much value you get per dollar spent

## What's New with Claude Sonnet 4.5?

Before looking at alternatives, it helps to understand what Claude Sonnet 4.5 does well. Released in early 2025, **[Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)** is Anthropic's latest model:

<ListCheck>

- **Best Coding Model**: Scores 77.2% on SWE-bench Verified and stays focused on complex tasks for 30+ hours
- **Computer Use Leader**: 61.4% on OSWorld benchmark, up from 42.2% with Sonnet 4
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Better reasoning and math capabilities
- **Improved Alignment**: Less sycophantic and deceptive behavior than previous models
- **Premium Pricing**: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens

</ListCheck>

Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.6 is powerful, but the price makes it hard to justify for many developers and businesses. Open source alternatives offer similar performance for much less money.

## 1. GLM-5: Agentic engineering with record-low hallucinations

**[GLM-5](https://docs.z.ai/guides/llm/glm-5)** is Z.AI's new flagship, and the jump from GLM-4.7 is significant. It went from 357B to 744B total parameters while keeping MoE efficiency at 40B active. Two things stand out: DeepSeek Sparse Attention for handling long contexts without blowing up inference costs, and a new RL infrastructure called "slime" that brought hallucination rates down to near zero. In coding benchmarks, it's approaching Claude Opus 4.5 territory.

**[MiniMax M2.5](https://www.minimax.io/news/minimax-m25)** is the latest in the M2 series, and the jump from M2.1 is substantial. MiniMax trained it with reinforcement learning across more than 200,000 real-world environments, pushing SWE-bench Verified to 80.2%, which beats Claude Opus 4.6 on multiple scaffolds. It ships in two speed tiers: M2.5 at 50 tokens/second and M2.5-Lightning at 100 tokens/second, both priced low enough to run agents continuously without worrying about cost.

### Technical Specifications

| Feature                  | MiniMax M2.5                          |

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key="your_openrouter_api_key"
)

# Use GLM-5 for agentic tasks
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="z-ai/glm-5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Create a Python web scraper for product prices"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### What the savings mean in practice

- **More experimentation**: Lower costs let you test and iterate more freely
- **Team-wide access**: Run AI assistance for your whole team, not just a few developers
- **Broader integration**: Use AI in more parts of your application
- **Faster shipping**: More AI-assisted development cycles without budget anxiety

## Tips and common mistakes

### What works

<ListCheck>

- **Match model to task**: Use cheaper models for simple tasks, bigger ones for complex reasoning
- **Manage context carefully**: Longer context costs more tokens, so be deliberate
- **Invest in prompts**: Each model responds differently to prompt style
- **Batch requests**: Combine calls to reduce overhead
- **Monitor outputs**: Track quality in your specific domain

</ListCheck>

### What to avoid

- **Over-Engineering**: Don't use the most expensive model for simple tasks
- **Inadequate Testing**: Always validate model outputs in your specific domain
- **Context Overflow**: Monitor token usage to avoid unexpected costs
- **Single Model Dependency**: Consider using different models for different tasks

## What's coming next for open source LLMs

A few trends worth watching:

- **Domain-specific models**: More specialized options like Qwen3 Coder
- **Better efficiency**: More performance per parameter and per dollar
- **Tighter tool integration**: Better compatibility with IDEs and coding workflows
- **Multimodal by default**: Vision and audio becoming standard, not optional
- **Faster inference**: Latency dropping enough for real-time use

## Which one should you pick?

It depends on what matters most to you:

### GLM-5 if you need:

- **Top coding scores**: 95.8% SWE-bench Verified, highest among open source
- **Agentic engineering**: Long-horizon multi-step planning
- **Low hallucinations**: Record-low rate, good for enterprise
- **Strong reasoning**: 92.7% on AIME 2026, 86.0% on GPQA-Diamond
- **MIT license**: Full commercial and self-hosting freedom
