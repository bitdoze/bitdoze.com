Claude Sonnet 4.5 works well for coding, but it's expensive. Plenty of developers are looking for alternatives that don't cost as much. The open source AI space has grown a lot since 2025, and now there are models that can do what Claude does for much less money.

This guide covers five open source models that can replace Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding: GLM-4.7, Kimi K2.5, Qwen-Max, MiniMax M2.1, and Devstral 2. These models handle reasoning, code generation, and agent tasks well, and they cost significantly less than Claude.

<Notice type="info" title="Cost Comparison Overview">

While Claude Sonnet 4.5 costs $3-15 per million tokens, these open source alternatives range from $0.20 to $1.20 per million input tokens, offering savings of up to 99%.

</Notice>

## Why Consider Open Source LLM Alternatives?

Open source models have improved a lot and can compete with proprietary options. Here's why they're worth considering:

<ListCheck>

- **Cost Efficiency**: API costs are much lower than proprietary models
- **Transparency**: Open source code lets you understand and modify the model
- **Performance Parity**: Many open source models match or beat Claude Sonnet 4.5 on various tasks
- **Flexibility**: You can self-host or use various API providers
- **Community Support**: Active development teams keep improving the models

</ListCheck>

### Key Performance Areas to Consider

When evaluating LLM alternatives, several factors matter:

- **Coding Capabilities**: How well the model generates, debugs, and explains code
- **Reasoning Performance**: How well it handles complex problems and logical thinking
- **Context Length**: How much information the model can process at once
- **Agentic Tasks**: Tool usage, function calling, and multi-step task execution
- **Cost-Performance Ratio**: How much value you get per dollar spent

## What's New with Claude Sonnet 4.5?

Before looking at alternatives, it helps to understand what Claude Sonnet 4.5 does well. Released in early 2025, **[Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5)** is Anthropic's latest model:
