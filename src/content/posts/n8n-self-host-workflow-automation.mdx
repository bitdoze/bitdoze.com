### How n8n Works

n8n operates on a node-based architecture where each node represents a specific function or service integration. Workflows are created by connecting these nodes in a logical sequence, with data flowing from one node to the next.

| Component Type | Purpose | Use Cases |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Trigger Nodes** | Initiate workflow execution | Webhook requests, scheduled tasks, file changes, email arrivals |
| **Regular Nodes** | Perform actions and transformations | API calls, data processing, file operations, notifications |
| **Control Nodes** | Manage workflow logic | Conditional branching, loops, error handling, data merging |
| **Code Nodes** | Execute custom scripts | Complex calculations, data transformations, custom API integrations |
| **Sub-workflow Nodes** | Reference other workflows | Modular design, reusable components, complex orchestration |

This modular approach enables you to build everything from simple data synchronization tasks to complex multi-step business processes involving multiple systems and decision points.
