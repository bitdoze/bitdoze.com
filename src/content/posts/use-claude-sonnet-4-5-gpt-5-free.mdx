</ListCheck>

### How to Get Started with Droid CLI

**Step 1: Sign Up and Install**

```bash
# Visit the website and create an account
# https://go.bitdoze.com/droid-cli

# Install the CLI tool (instructions provided after signup)
curl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh
```

**Step 2: Launch and Configure**

```bash

**Step 4: Enable Reasoning (Optional)**

For complex tasks requiring deep thinking, you can enable reasoning mode which allows the model to think through problems step-by-step before responding.

### Real-World Usage Example

Here's how I use Droid CLI in my daily workflow:

```bash
# Launch Droid
droid

# Select Claude Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5

## Method 4: Google Antigravity IDE - Free Gemini 3 Pro Access

**[Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** is Google's agentic development platform available in public preview with rate limits on Gemini 3 Pro usage. It also includes access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, and GPT-OSS models.

### What is Google Antigravity?

Google Antigravity is an agent-first platform where AI agents can autonomously plan and execute software tasks. It provides an IDE experience with browser control capabilities, asynchronous interaction patterns, and multi-agent orchestration.

### Key Features

<ListCheck>

- **Free Gemini 3 Pro Access**: Rate limits during public preview
- **Multi-Model Support**: Access Gemini 3, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.5, and GPT-OSS
- **Browser Control**: Agents can autonomously control browser for testing
- **Asynchronous Workflows**: Spawn and orchestrate multiple agents in parallel
- **Dual Interface**: Editor view for synchronous work, Manager view for agent orchestration
- **Knowledge Management**: Agent learns from past work and feedback
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with MacOS, Linux, and Windows

</ListCheck>

### Core Tenets of Antigravity

Google built Antigravity around four key principles:

| Tenet               | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trust**           | Task-level abstractions with artifacts and verification results for user validation |
| **Autonomy**        | Agents operate across code editor, terminal, and browser simultaneously             |
| **Feedback**        | Async feedback through Google-doc-style comments on text and visual artifacts       |
| **Self-improvement**| Knowledge management allows agents to learn from past work                          |

### How Antigravity Works

**Editor View (Synchronous):**
- AI-powered IDE experience
- Tab completions and inline commands
- Fully functioning agent in the side panel
- Focused, hands-on development

**Manager View (Asynchronous):**
- Mission control for spawning multiple agents
- Orchestrate agents across multiple workspaces in parallel
- Inbox notifications for agent progress
- Running background research while focusing on other tasks

### Artifacts and Verification

Unlike tools that show every single tool call or only the final code change, Antigravity provides context at a natural task-level abstraction through Artifacts:

<ListCheck>

- **Task Lists**: Clear breakdown of what the agent will accomplish
- **Implementation Plans**: Review before implementation begins
- **Walkthroughs**: Understand what was done at completion
- **Screenshots**: Visual verification of browser-based testing
- **Browser Recordings**: Full recordings of automated testing sessions

</ListCheck>

### How to Get Started with Antigravity

**Step 1: Visit the Platform**

Go to [antigravity.google](https://antigravity.google/) and sign up for the public preview.

**Step 2: Download and Install**

Download the Antigravity IDE for your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows).

**Step 3: Choose Your Model**

Select from available models:

- **Gemini 3 Pro** - Google's most intelligent model (generous free limits)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** - Anthropic's top coding model
- **Claude Opus 4.5** - Anthropic's most powerful model for complex reasoning
- **GPT-OSS** - OpenAI's model offering

**Step 4: Start Building**

Use either the Editor view for hands-on coding or the Manager view to spawn autonomous agents for complex tasks.

### Real-World Use Case Example

```
Task: "Build a new frontend feature and verify it works"

The Antigravity Agent will:
1. Write code for the new frontend feature
2. Use the terminal to launch localhost
3. Actuate the browser to test the feature works
4. Provide screenshots and recordings as verification
5. All without manual intervention
```

### Best Use Cases for Antigravity

- **Full-Stack Development**: Leverage browser control for end-to-end testing
- **Complex Multi-File Projects**: Let agents plan and execute across your codebase
- **Parallel Development**: Run multiple agents on different tasks simultaneously
- **Automated Testing**: Agents verify their own work through browser automation
- **Research Tasks**: Spawn background agents for research while you focus elsewhere
