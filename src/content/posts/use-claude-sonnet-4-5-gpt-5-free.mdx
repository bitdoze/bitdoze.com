## Why Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5?

Before diving into the free methods, let's understand why these models are worth your attention:

<ListCheck>

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Best coding model in the world with 77.2% on SWE-bench Verified, capable of maintaining focus for 30+ hours on complex tasks
- **GPT-5**: OpenAI's latest flagship model with enhanced reasoning, extended thinking capabilities, and superior performance across multiple domains
- **Premium Performance**: Both models excel at coding, reasoning, content creation, and agentic tasks
- **Production Ready**: Proven reliability for professional development and business applications

</ListCheck>

The challenge? Premium pricing can be prohibitive. Claude Sonnet 4.5 costs $3-15 per million tokens, while GPT-5 has similar premium pricing. That's where these free alternatives come in.

## Method 1: Droid CLI - 40 Million Free Tokens First Month

**[Droid CLI by Factory AI](https://go.bitdoze.com/droid-cli)** is my top recommendation for developers who want extensive free access to premium AI models. This command-line tool offers an incredible 40 million tokens first month at no cost.

### What is Droid CLI?

Droid CLI is a powerful command-line interface that provides direct access to multiple AI models including Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, and Claude Opus. It's designed specifically for developers who prefer working in the terminal or need to integrate AI into their workflows.

### Key Features

<ListCheck>

- **40 Million Free Tokens**: Generous first month allowance for extensive testing and development
- **Multiple Model Support**: Access Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5, Claude Opus, and more
- **CLI Integration**: Works seamlessly in your terminal environment
- **IDE Support**: Integrates with popular development environments
- **Reasoning Mode**: Enable extended thinking for complex problem-solving
- **Real-Time Usage Tracking**: Monitor your token consumption

</ListCheck>

### How to Get Started with Droid CLI

**Step 1: Sign Up and Install**

```bash
# Visit the website and create an account
# https://go.bitdoze.com/droid-cli

# Install the CLI tool (instructions provided after signup)
curl -fsSL https://app.factory.ai/cli | sh
```

**Step 2: Launch and Configure**

```bash
# Start Droid CLI
droid

# The interface will prompt you to choose your model
```

**Step 3: Select Your Model**

When you launch Droid, you'll see options to choose between:

- Claude Sonnet 4.5
- GPT-5
- Claude Opus
- Other supported models

**Step 4: Enable Reasoning (Optional)**

For complex tasks requiring deep thinking, you can enable reasoning mode which allows the model to think through problems step-by-step before responding.

### Real-World Usage Example

Here's how I use Droid CLI in my daily workflow:

```bash
# Launch Droid
droid

# Select Claude Sonnet 4.5
# Enable reasoning mode for complex tasks

# Example prompt
"Create a Python web scraper that extracts product prices from e-commerce sites,
handles pagination, and exports data to CSV with error handling"
```

The model will process your request and provide comprehensive code with explanations. Each interaction consumes tokens from your 40 million first month allowance.

### Monitoring Your Usage

<Notice type="info" title="Token Tracking">

Droid CLI provides real-time usage statistics. You can refresh your dashboard to see exactly how many tokens you've consumed. A typical complex prompt might use 20,000-30,000 tokens, giving you plenty of room for extensive development work.

</Notice>
