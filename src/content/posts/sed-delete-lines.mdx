## Basic sed Syntax for Line Deletion

Understanding sed's syntax is key to effective line deletion. The basic structure combines addresses (which lines to target) with the delete command (`d`).

### Core Components

**Basic syntax:**
```shell
sed 'ADDRESS d' filename
```

- **ADDRESS**: Specifies which lines to delete
- **d**: The delete command
- **filename**: Target file (or stdin if omitted)

### Addressing Methods

**1. Line numbers:**
```shell
sed '5d' file.txt          # Delete line 5
sed '1d' file.txt          # Delete first line
sed '$d' file.txt          # Delete last line
```

**2. Line ranges:**
```shell
sed '2,5d' file.txt        # Delete lines 2-5
sed '10,$d' file.txt       # Delete from line 10 to end
sed '1,3d' file.txt        # Delete first 3 lines
```

**3. Pattern matching:**
```shell
sed '/error/d' file.txt    # Delete lines containing "error"
sed '/^#/d' file.txt       # Delete lines starting with #
sed '/^$/d' file.txt       # Delete empty lines
```

**4. Regular expressions:**
```shell
sed '/^[0-9]/d' file.txt   # Delete lines starting with digits
sed '/\.log$/d' file.txt   # Delete lines ending with .log
```

### Key Options

| Option | Function | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `-i` | Edit files in-place | `sed -i '1d' file.txt` |
| `-i.bak` | Edit in-place with backup | `sed -i.bak '1d' file.txt` |
| `-n` | Suppress default output | Used with `p` command |

### Execution Flow

sed operates in a simple cycle:
1. **Read** a line into pattern space
2. **Apply** commands (like delete)
3. **Output** remaining lines (unless deleted)
4. **Repeat** for next line

**Important**: sed processes each line independently, making it perfect for stream processing and large files.

## Deleting Specific Lines

sed makes targeting and deleting specific lines straightforward with its flexible addressing system.

### Delete by Line Number

**Single line deletion:**
```shell
sed '2d' filename          # Delete line 2
sed '1d' filename          # Delete first line
sed '$d' filename          # Delete last line
```

**Multiple specific lines:**
```shell
sed '1d;3d;5d' filename    # Delete lines 1, 3, and 5
sed -e '2d' -e '5d' filename # Alternative syntax
```

### Delete Line Ranges

**Continuous ranges:**
```shell
sed '10,20d' filename      # Delete lines 10-20
sed '1,5d' filename        # Delete first 5 lines
sed '10,$d' filename       # Delete from line 10 to end
```

**Practical examples:**
```shell
sed '1d' config.txt        # Remove header line
sed '$d' data.txt          # Remove footer/last line
sed '2,4d' log.txt         # Remove lines 2-4
```

### Delete by Pattern Matching

**Simple patterns:**
```shell
sed '/error/d' logfile.txt    # Delete lines containing "error"
sed '/^#/d' config.txt        # Delete comment lines
sed '/^$/d' file.txt          # Delete empty lines
```

**Case sensitivity:**
```shell
sed '/Error/d' file.txt       # Case-sensitive (matches "Error")
sed '/[Ee]rror/d' file.txt    # Matches "Error" or "error"
```

### Advanced Pattern Examples

**Lines starting with specific characters:**
```shell
sed '/^[0-9]/d' file.txt      # Delete lines starting with digits
sed '/^[A-Z]/d' file.txt      # Delete lines starting with uppercase
```

**Lines ending with patterns:**
```shell
sed '/\.log$/d' file.txt      # Delete lines ending with ".log"
sed '/;$/d' code.txt          # Delete lines ending with semicolon
```

**Complex patterns:**
```shell
sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' file.txt  # Delete blank lines (including whitespace)
sed '/^[[:space:]]*#/d' file.txt  # Delete comment lines with leading spaces
```

### Safety and Testing

**Preview changes first:**
```shell
sed '2d' file.txt             # Shows output without modifying file
sed '2d' file.txt > new.txt   # Save to new file
```

**In-place editing with backup:**
```shell
sed -i.backup '2d' file.txt   # Creates file.txt.backup
```

**Test with line numbers:**
```shell
nl file.txt | sed '2d'        # Show line numbers to verify targeting
```

### Practical Use Cases

- **Log cleaning**: `sed '/DEBUG/d' app.log`
- **Config files**: `sed '/^#/d' nginx.conf`
- **Data processing**: `sed '1d' data.csv` (remove CSV header)
- **Code cleanup**: `sed '/^\/\//d' script.js` (remove JS comments)

**Pro tip**: Always test your sed commands on sample data before applying to important files.

## Pattern-Based Line Deletion with Regular Expressions

sed's pattern matching capabilities combined with regular expressions provide powerful tools for precise line deletion based on content rather than position.

### Basic Pattern Matching

**Simple string patterns:**
```sh
sed '/error/d' filename       # Delete lines containing "error"
sed '/warning/d' logfile.txt  # Delete lines with "warning"
sed '/DEBUG/d' app.log        # Delete debug messages
```

**Word boundaries for exact matches:**
```sh
sed '/\berror\b/d' filename   # Delete lines with exact word "error"
sed '/\btest\b/d' file.txt    # Avoids matching "testing" or "retest"
```

### Regular Expression Patterns

**Character classes:**
```sh
sed '/[0-9]/d' filename       # Delete lines containing any digit
sed '/[A-Z]/d' filename       # Delete lines with uppercase letters
sed '/[aeiou]/d' filename     # Delete lines containing vowels
```

**Anchors (position matching):**
```sh
sed '/^error/d' filename      # Delete lines starting with "error"
sed '/error$/d' filename      # Delete lines ending with "error"
sed '/^[0-9]/d' filename      # Delete lines starting with digits
```

**Quantifiers:**
```sh
sed '/[0-9]\{3\}/d' filename     # Delete lines with 3+ consecutive digits
sed '/^.\{80,\}/d' filename      # Delete lines longer than 80 chars
sed '/error.*critical/d' file    # Delete lines with "error" followed by "critical"
```

### Advanced Pattern Examples

**Empty and whitespace lines:**
```sh
sed '/^$/d' filename              # Delete empty lines
sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' filename  # Delete blank lines (including whitespace)
sed '/^\s*$/d' filename           # Alternative for whitespace-only lines
```

**Comment patterns:**
```sh
sed '/^#/d' config.txt            # Delete lines starting with #
sed '/^[[:space:]]*#/d' file.txt  # Delete comments with leading whitespace
sed '/^\/\//d' script.js          # Delete JavaScript comments
sed '/^\/\*/d' style.css          # Delete CSS comment starts
```

**Complex patterns:**
```sh
sed '/^[0-9]\{4\}-[0-9]\{2\}-[0-9]\{2\}/d' file.txt  # Delete date lines (YYYY-MM-DD)
sed '/^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]\+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]\+\.[a-zA-Z]\{2,\}/d' file.txt  # Delete email lines
```

### Negation and Inverse Matching

**Keep only matching lines (delete non-matches):**
```sh
sed '/success/!d' filename    # Keep only lines with "success"
sed '/^#/!d' config.txt       # Keep only comment lines
sed '/error/!d' log.txt       # Keep only error lines
```

### Extended Regular Expressions

**Using sed -E for enhanced patterns:**
```sh
sed -E '/^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$/d' file.txt    # Delete phone numbers
sed -E '/^(http|https):/d' urls.txt                   # Delete HTTP URLs
sed -E '/^[A-Z]{2,}/d' file.txt                       # Delete lines starting with 2+ caps
```

### Practical Examples

**Log file cleanup:**
```sh
sed '/INFO/d' app.log         # Remove info messages
sed '/^\[.*DEBUG.*\]/d' log   # Remove debug entries
sed '/^$/d' access.log        # Remove empty lines
```

**Configuration files:**
```sh
sed '/^#/d' nginx.conf        # Remove comments
sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' config.ini  # Remove blank lines
```

**Data processing:**
```sh
sed '/^test/d' data.txt       # Remove test entries
sed '/,$/d' csv.txt           # Remove lines ending with comma
```

### Safety and Testing

**Preview patterns before deletion:**
```sh
grep 'pattern' filename       # See what will be deleted
sed -n '/pattern/p' filename  # Print matching lines
```

**Test with line numbers:**
```sh
nl filename | sed '/pattern/d'  # Show line numbers for context
```

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Forgetting to escape special characters: `/./d` vs `/\./d`
- Case sensitivity: Use `[Ee]rror` for both cases
- Overly broad patterns: Use word boundaries `\b` when needed

**Pro tip**: Regular expressions are powerful but can be tricky. Test your patterns thoroughly before applying to important files.

## Advanced Line Deletion Techniques

For complex text processing tasks, sed offers sophisticated features that go beyond basic pattern matching and line ranges.

### Range-Based Pattern Deletion

**Delete between pattern markers:**
```sh
sed '/START/,/END/d' file.txt         # Delete from START to END markers
sed '/BEGIN/,/FINISH/d' config.txt    # Delete configuration blocks
sed '/<!--/,/-->/d' html.txt          # Delete HTML comments
```

**Delete from pattern to line number:**
```sh
sed '/ERROR/,10d' file.txt            # Delete from first ERROR to line 10
sed '5,/STOP/d' file.txt              # Delete from line 5 to first STOP
```

**Delete from pattern to end of file:**
```sh
sed '/FOOTER/,$d' file.txt            # Delete from FOOTER to end
sed '/^---/,$d' document.txt          # Delete from separator to end
```

### Multi-Line Pattern Deletion

**Delete paragraph blocks:**
```sh
sed '/^$/,/^$/d' file.txt             # Delete empty line blocks
sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/,/^[[:space:]]*$/d' file.txt  # Include whitespace-only lines
```

**Delete function definitions (example in code):**
```sh
sed '/^function/,/^}/d' script.js     # Delete JavaScript functions
sed '/^def /,/^$/d' script.py         # Delete Python function definitions
```

### Conditional Deletion

**Delete lines matching multiple conditions:**
```sh
sed '/error.*critical/d' log.txt     # Delete lines with both "error" and "critical"
sed '/^[0-9].*error/d' file.txt      # Delete lines starting with digit and containing "error"
```

**Delete except specific patterns:**
```sh
sed '/INFO\|WARN\|ERROR/!d' log.txt  # Keep only log levels, delete everything else
sed '/^[A-Za-z]/!d' file.txt         # Keep only lines starting with letters
```

### Using Address Ranges with Steps

**Delete every nth line:**
```sh
sed '1~2d' file.txt                   # Delete every odd line (1st, 3rd, 5th...)
sed '2~3d' file.txt                   # Delete every 3rd line starting from line 2
sed '0~5d' file.txt                   # Delete every 5th line
```

### Working with Hold and Pattern Space

**Delete duplicate consecutive lines:**
```sh
sed '$!N; /^\(.*\)\n\1$/d' file.txt   # Remove consecutive duplicate lines
```

**Delete lines based on next line content:**
```sh
sed '$!N; /error\n/d' file.txt        # Delete lines followed by lines containing "error"
```

### Complex Multi-Command Operations

**Combine multiple deletion criteria:**
```sh
sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^$/d' -e '/DEBUG/d' file.txt    # Remove comments, empty lines, and debug
```

**Script-based complex deletion:**
```sh
sed -f delete_script.sed file.txt
```

Where `delete_script.sed` contains:
```
/^#/d
/^$/d
/DEBUG/d
/^[[:space:]]*$/d
```

### Practical Advanced Examples

**Clean log files:**
```sh
# Remove debug, empty lines, and timestamp lines
sed -e '/DEBUG/d' -e '/^$/d' -e '/^\[.*\]$/d' app.log
```

**Process configuration files:**
```sh
# Remove comments and empty lines, keep only active config
sed -e '/^[[:space:]]*#/d' -e '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' nginx.conf
```

**Code cleanup:**
```sh
# Remove empty lines, single-line comments, and console.log statements
sed -e '/^$/d' -e '/^[[:space:]]*\/\//d' -e '/console\.log/d' script.js
```

### Advanced Safety Practices

**Test complex commands step by step:**
```sh
# Step 1: Test first condition
sed '/^#/d' file.txt | head -20

# Step 2: Add second condition
sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^$/d' file.txt | head -20

# Step 3: Add final conditions
sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^$/d' -e '/DEBUG/d' file.txt | head -20
```

**Use intermediate files for complex operations:**
```sh
sed '/START/,/END/d' file.txt > temp1.txt
sed '/ERROR/d' temp1.txt > temp2.txt
sed '/^$/d' temp2.txt > final.txt
```

**Backup and restore capabilities:**
```sh
cp original.txt original.txt.backup
sed -i.$(date +%Y%m%d) 'complex_deletion_commands' original.txt
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Large files**: Use specific patterns rather than broad matches
- **Multiple files**: Combine operations where possible
- **Memory usage**: Complex hold space operations can consume memory
- **Speed**: Simple line number ranges are faster than complex regex patterns

**Pro tip**: For extremely complex deletion logic, consider combining sed with other tools like awk or writing a custom script for better maintainability.
