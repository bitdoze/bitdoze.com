- Configure environment variables through UI
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests
- Add custom domain (optional)
- Implement production monitoring

**Best part**: No adapters, no config files, no complex setup!

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- An existing Astro + Convex project ([follow our previous guide](/astro-convex-realtime-app/))
- A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com) (free tier works perfectly)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) repository with your code
- That's it! No CLI tools or configuration needed



##  Step 1: Prepare Your Convex Production Deployment

### Create Production Deployment

First, let's create a production deployment in Convex:

```sh
cd your-project-directory
npx convex deploy
```

This command will:
- Create a new production deployment
- Deploy your functions and schema
- Generate a production deployment URL

### Get Your Production Deploy Key

1. Visit the [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Deploy Keys**
4. Click **Generate Production Deploy Key**
5. Copy the key - you'll need it for Vercel

```sh
# The key will look like this:
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your-production-deploy-key-here
```
### Add Vercel Connector to Astro

In order for the connectivity to work you need to add vercel adapter this will make your project work on vercel. The command will configure everything for you at Astro level.

```sh
npx astro add vercel
```

## Step 2: Push the Repo on GitHub

You need to add the repo to GitHub, just create a new repo on Github and push everything:

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:bitdoze/test-repo.git
git branch -M main
git add -A
git commit -m "changes to code"
git push -u origin main
```

##  Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Super Simple!)

### Connect Your Repository

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Sign in with GitHub (recommended)

2. **Import Your Project**
