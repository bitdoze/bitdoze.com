This comprehensive review covers Hetzner Cloud, a VPS provider that offers affordable and reliable cloud servers for hosting websites and applications. We'll examine how Hetzner performs in terms of disk, CPU, network, and WordPress tests, and compare it with other VPS providers such as DigitalOcean. We'll also explore the interface, support, and share real-world experience from over 5 years of usage.

I've been using Hetzner as my primary VPS provider in Europe for more than 5 years, running a CyberPanel server where I host several of my sites. Recently, Hetzner has expanded significantly with new datacenters in the US and Singapore, making it a truly global option for developers and businesses.

## Why Hetzner Cloud Stands Out

Hetzner has built a reputation for offering some of the most competitive prices in the VPS market. What sets them apart isn't just the cost—it's the combination of performance, reliability, and value. With about €6, you can get a 2CPU, 2GB RAM server that would cost €15-20 USD at competitors like DigitalOcean or Vultr.

I've been running multiple services on Hetzner including:
- CyberPanel for website hosting
- Monitoring solutions
- Analytics platforms
- Development environments


## Hetzner Cloud Datacenters (2025 Update)

Hetzner has significantly expanded their global presence. Here's the current datacenter lineup:

| Datacenter | Location | CPU Types Available | Network |
|------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Nuremberg | Germany | Intel/AMD/ARM | 20TB included |
| Falkenstein | Germany | Intel/AMD/ARM | 20TB included |
| Helsinki | Finland | Intel/AMD/ARM | 20TB included |
| Ashburn | Virginia, USA | AMD | 1TB included |
| Hillsboro | Oregon, USA | AMD | 1TB included |
| Singapore | Singapore | AMD | 1TB included |

**2025 Updates:**
- Singapore datacenter now fully operational (launched 2024)
- Improved network capacity across all locations
- Enhanced ARM server availability in European locations
- New CX shared vCPU plans introduced in 2024

<Notice type="warning" title="Bandwidth Differences">
    European datacenters include 20TB of bandwidth, while US and Singapore locations include 1TB. Plan accordingly based on your traffic needs.

## Hetzner Cloud Pricing (2025)

Hetzner's pricing remains highly competitive, though there have been some adjustments for US datacenters. Here's the current pricing structure:

### WordPress Performance Test

I installed a fresh WordPress site with:
- **Theme**: Kadence starter template
- **Caching**: LiteSpeed Cache plugin
- **Server**: OpenLiteSpeed via CyberPanel
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0

#### GTmetrix Results:
- **Performance Score**: 97%
- **Structure Score**: 91%
- **LCP**: 1.2s
- **TBT**: 0ms
- **CLS**: 0.01

#### PageSpeed Insights:
- **Mobile Score**: 94
- **Desktop Score**: 99
- **First Contentful Paint**: 1.1s

These results are excellent for a €6.90/month server with no CDN or advanced optimizations.

### Load Testing with k6

I stress-tested the server with 200 concurrent users:

```bash
# k6 run --vus 200 --duration 120s load-test.js

running (2m01.2s), 000/200 VUs, 23,847 complete and 0 interrupted iterations
