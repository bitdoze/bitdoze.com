Building web applications with Python doesn't have to be complicated. Two frameworks make it especially easy: **Streamlit** and **NiceGUI**. Both let you create interactive web apps using only Python, but they excel in different areas.

**[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** specializes in data science and machine learning apps. It transforms Python scripts into web applications automatically, with built-in support for charts, dataframes, and ML models. Perfect for dashboards and data visualization.

**[NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/)** focuses on creating desktop-like web applications. Built on FastAPI with Vue.js frontend, it offers more control over UI components and interactions, making it ideal for general-purpose web apps.

## Quick Comparison Overview

| Feature | Streamlit | NiceGUI |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Best For** | Data apps, dashboards | General web apps, desktop-like UIs |
| **Learning Curve** | Very easy | Easy |
| **Customization** | Limited | High |
| **Backend** | Built-in | FastAPI |
| **Real-time Updates** | Automatic reruns | Event-driven |

- **Rapid development** with minimal coding
- **Built-in data handling** (CSV, JSON, databases)
- **Easy deployment** on Streamlit Cloud

**Example use cases:**
- Sales analytics dashboard
- Machine learning model demo
- Financial data explorer
- Research data visualization

### Choose **NiceGUI** if you need:
- **Desktop-like applications** in the browser

- Interactive forms and surveys
- Real-time monitoring systems

## Getting Started: Code Examples

Both frameworks are beginner-friendly, but Streamlit has a slight edge for absolute beginners.

### Streamlit Example: Data Dashboard

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

st.title('Sales Dashboard')

# Generate sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Month': ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr'],
    'Sales': [100, 150, 120, 200]
})

# Interactive elements
month_filter = st.selectbox('Select Month', data['Month'])
filtered_data = data[data['Month'] == month_filter]

# Display results
st.bar_chart(data.set_index('Month'))
st.write(f'Sales for {month_filter}: ${filtered_data["Sales"].values[0]}')
```

### NiceGUI Example: Interactive Form

```python
from nicegui import ui

def handle_submit():
    ui.notify(f'Hello {name.value}! You are {age.value} years old.')

ui.label('User Information Form')

with ui.row():
    name = ui.input('Name', placeholder='Enter your name')
    age = ui.number('Age', value=25, min=0, max=120)

ui.button('Submit', on_click=handle_submit)

ui.run()
```
