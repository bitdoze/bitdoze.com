Python’s ecosystem has long been a powerhouse for developers, but managing dependencies, virtual environments, and Python versions has often felt clunky with traditional tools like `pip` and `venv`. Enter `uv`, a next-generation Python package and project manager written in Rust by the Astral team (known for the popular `ruff` linter).

Launched in February 2024, `uv` has rapidly gained traction for its speed (10-100x faster than `pip`), seamless integration with existing workflows, and all-in-one approach to Python project management. In this article, we’ll walk through how to start using `uv` and set up a Python project from scratch, leveraging the latest features as of March 2025.

## What is uv?

`uv` is an all-in-one Python tool designed to replace a patchwork of utilities like `pip` (package installer), `venv` (virtual environment manager), and even `poetry` (project manager). Built in Rust, it boasts performance that’s 10-100x faster than traditional tools, thanks to its optimized dependency resolver and aggressive caching strategy. It’s not just a package installer—it’s a full-fledged project manager that handles Python versions, virtual environments, dependencies, and script execution with ease.

Key features of `uv` include:
- **Speed**: Installs packages and resolves dependencies in seconds, not minutes.
- **Unified Workflow**: Combines environment creation, package management, and script running into one tool.
- **Standards Compliance**: Uses the standard `pyproject.toml` for configuration and a cross-platform `uv.lock` file for reproducible builds.
- **No Manual Activation**: Automatically manages virtual environments without requiring you to activate them manually.

As of March 2025, `uv` has matured significantly since its initial release, with stable support for project management, Python version handling, and seamless integration into existing workflows. Let’s see how to set it up.

## Setting Up Your Python Project with `uv`
In this section we are going to set up a Python project using `uv`. We are going to install `uv` and create a new project.

</Notice>

### Step 1: Installing uv

To use `uv`, you first need to install it. Unlike many Python tools, `uv` doesn’t require a pre-existing Python installation because it can manage Python versions itself. However, it’s recommended to install it directly rather than via `pip` to avoid dependency conflicts with your system Python. Here’s how to install the latest version (as of March 2025, version 0.6.5 is available on PyPI, but always check [astral.sh](https://astral.sh) for updates):

#### On macOS/Linux

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
This downloads and installs `uv` as a standalone binary.

Log:

```sh
downloading uv 0.6.6 aarch64-apple-darwin
no checksums to verify
installing to /Users/user/.local/bin
  uv
  uvx
everything's installed!

To add $HOME/.local/bin to your PATH, either restart your shell or run:

    source $HOME/.local/bin/env (sh, bash, zsh)
    source $HOME/.local/bin/env.fish (fish)
WARNING: The following commands are shadowed by other commands in your PATH: uv uvx
```


#### On Windows

Using PowerShell:


```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

#### Verify Installation

After installation, confirm it worked by checking the version:

```bash
uv --version
```
You should see something like `uv 0.6.6`. If not, ensure `uv` is added to your system PATH (the installer usually handles this, but you might need to restart your terminal).

Log:

```sh
╰─❯ uv --version
uv 0.6.6 (c1a0bb85e 2025-03-12)
```


### Step 2: Initializing a New Project

With `uv` installed, let’s create a new Python project. `uv` makes this a breeze with the `uv init` command, which sets up a basic project structure.

1. **Create a Project Directory**:

   Navigate to where you want your project and run:

   ```bash
   uv init my-python-project
   cd my-python-project
   ```

      This sets up a minimal project structure tailored for quick starts. As of March 2025, running `uv init` generates the following files and directories in your project root:
      ```
      my-python-project/
    ├── .python-version  # Specifies the pinned Python version (e.g., "3.12")
    ├── main.py         # A simple starter Python script
    ├── pyproject.toml  # Project configuration file
    └── README.md       # Basic project documentation (empty by default)
      ```
      *Note:* Depending on your setup, you might also see hidden directories like `.git` (if you initialize a Git repository) or `.ropeproject` (if you're using an IDE like PyCharm with Rope for refactoring). These are not created by `uv` itself but may appear based on your environment or subsequent actions.

      The `pyproject.toml` file is the core of your project, following the PEP 621 standard. It looks something like this:
      ```toml
      [project]
      name = "my-python-project"
      version = "0.1.0"
      description = "Add your description here"
      readme = "README.md"
      requires-python = ">=3.13"
      dependencies = []
      ```
      The `main.py` file comes with a basic "Hello, World!" example:
      ```python
          def main():
        print("Hello from my-python-project!")


        if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

      ```
          The `.python-version` file pins the Python version (e.g., `3.13`), and `README.md` starts as an empty file ready for your project description.

   2. **Set a Python Version (Optional)**
      The `.python-version` file is created automatically by `uv init`, typically defaulting to the latest Python version available on your system (e.g., 3.12). To change it to a specific version:
      ```bash
      uv python pin 3.12
      ```
      This updates `.python-version` and ensures consistency across machines.  Be sure to update the `requires-python = ">=3.12"` before in `pyproject.toml`.



### Step 3: Setting Up a Virtual Environment

With traditional tools, you’d manually create a virtual environment using `python -m venv`. `uv` simplifies this with the `uv venv` command, automatically placing it in a `.venv` folder in your project root.

Run:
```bash
uv venv
```
You’ll see output like:
```
Using Python 3.12.7
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

To activate it:
- **macOS/Linux**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows**: `.venv\Scripts\activate`

However, `uv` often eliminates the need to manually activate environments by handling this automatically with commands like `uv run` (more on that later).


### Step 4: Adding Dependencies

Now, let’s add some packages to your project. `uv` manages dependencies via `pyproject.toml`, and you can add them interactively or manually.

#### Interactive Method

To add `requests` (a popular HTTP library):
```bash
uv add requests
```
This updates `pyproject.toml` with:
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.32.3",
]
```
It also creates a `uv.lock` file, a cross-platform lockfile ensuring reproducible builds by pinning exact versions.




#### Manual Method

*Add the packages to `pyproject.toml`*

Edit `pyproject.toml` directly. For example:
```toml
[project]
name = "my-python-project"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.115.6",
    "pandas>=2.2.1",
]
[dependency-groups]
dev = ["pytest>=8.3.4"]
```
Here, `fastapi` and `pandas` are production dependencies, while `pytest` is a development dependency.

**Installing Dependencies**

To install all dependencies (including dev ones) into your virtual environment:
```bash
uv sync
```
```bash
❯ uv sync
Resolved 25 packages in 1.37s
Prepared 18 packages in 3.28s
Installed 18 packages in 51ms
 + annotated-types==0.7.0
 + anyio==4.8.0
 + fastapi==0.115.11
 + iniconfig==2.0.0
 + numpy==2.2.3
 + packaging==24.2
 + pandas==2.2.3
 + pluggy==1.5.0
 + pydantic==2.10.6
 + pydantic-core==2.27.2
 + pytest==8.3.5
 + python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
 + pytz==2025.1
 + six==1.17.0
 + sniffio==1.3.1
 + starlette==0.46.1
 + typing-extensions==4.12.2
 + tzdata==2025.1
```


This reads `pyproject.toml`, resolves dependencies, and installs them into `.venv`. If you only want production dependencies, use:
```bash
uv sync --no-dev
```

The speed of `uv sync` is remarkable—often completing in milliseconds compared to minutes with `pip`.

### Step 5: Writing and Running Code

Let’s create a simple script. In `my_python_project/main.py`, add:
```python
import requests

def fetch_data():
    response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
    print(response.json())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_data()
```

To run it, use:
```bash
uv run python main.py
```
`uv run` ensures the script runs in the project's virtual environment, installing dependencies if needed. You can also run it directly:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Step 6: Managing Your Project

As your project grows, `uv` offers tools to keep it organized.

- **Update Dependencies**
  To upgrade packages to their latest compatible versions:
  ```bash
  uv sync --upgrade
  ```

- **Export to requirements.txt**
  If you need a traditional `requirements.txt`:
  ```bash
  uv export --format requirements-txt > requirements.txt
  ```

- **Run Commands**
  Execute any command in the project environment:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```



### Step 7: Managing Python Versions
List installed Python versions:
```bash
uv python list
```
Install a specific version:
```bash
uv python install 3.11
```



### Step 8: Removing Packages with uv

As your project evolves, you might need to remove a package that’s no longer needed. With `uv`, uninstalling dependencies is just as straightforward as adding them, and it keeps your project configuration and environment in sync.

1. **Remove a Package**
   Suppose you added `requests` earlier but no longer need it. To remove it:
   ```bash
   uv remove requests
   ```
   This command:
   - Deletes `requests` from the `[project.dependencies]` section in your `pyproject.toml`.
   - Uninstalls the package from the virtual environment (`.venv`).
   - Updates the `uv.lock` file to reflect the change, ensuring reproducibility.

   For example, if your `pyproject.toml` originally had:
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "my-python-project"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "A new Python project"
   requires-python = ">=3.12"
   dependencies = [
       "requests>=2.31.0",
   ]
   ```
   After running `uv remove requests`, it becomes:
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "my-python-project"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "A new Python project"
   requires-python = ">=3.12"
   dependencies = []
   ```

2. **Remove a Development Dependency**
   If you installed a development dependency like `pytest` with `uv add --dev pytest` and want to remove it:
   ```bash
   uv remove --dev pytest
   ```
   This targets the `[dependency-groups.dev]` section in `pyproject.toml` and removes `pytest` from both the configuration and the virtual environment.

3. **Sync the Environment (Optional)**
   While `uv remove` typically updates the environment automatically, you can ensure everything is consistent by running:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   This reconciles the virtual environment with the updated `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, removing any orphaned packages.

4. **Manual Removal (Not Recommended)**
   If you manually edit `pyproject.toml` to remove a dependency (e.g., deleting `requests` from the `dependencies` list), `uv` won’t automatically uninstall it from `.venv` until you run `uv sync`. Stick to `uv remove` to avoid this extra step and keep your project clean.



## Why Choose uv in 2025?

By March 2025, `uv` has solidified its place as a game-changer in Python development. Its speed alone—often installing dependencies 10-20x faster than `pip`—is a compelling reason to switch. Add to that its seamless integration with modern standards (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`), automatic Python version management, and a streamlined workflow, and it’s clear why developers, including the FastAPI team, have adopted it.

For beginners, `uv` reduces the complexity of managing Python environments. For pros, it saves time and ensures reproducibility. Whether you’re building a small script or a large application, `uv` adapts to your needs.
