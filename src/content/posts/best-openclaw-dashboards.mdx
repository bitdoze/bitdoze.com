Once you have [OpenClaw running on a VPS or Mac Mini](/clawdbot-setup-guide/), the terminal gets old fast. You start wanting to see what your agent is actually doing — which sessions are active, what it's spending on API calls, which scheduled jobs ran last night. That's where dashboards come in.

Several have appeared over the last year. Some are full orchestration platforms that let you create tasks and dispatch multiple agents. Others are single-file monitors you drop on the same server and forget about. I went through nine of the most popular ones so you can pick the right fit without spending a day trying each.

<Notice type="info" title="What This Covers">
Nine OpenClaw dashboard and command center projects, sorted by star count. Includes quick-start setup, key features, and which use case each one fits best.

## 1. Mission Control — Best Overall

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control" variant="solid" color="blue" size="md" />

Mission Control is the most popular OpenClaw dashboard by a margin. It's built around a Kanban board where tasks move through seven stages: Planning → Inbox → Assigned → In Progress → Testing → Review → Done. When you create a task, an AI planning flow asks clarifying questions before spinning up a specialized agent to execute it.

The project connects to the OpenClaw gateway over WebSocket, so tasks get dispatched in real time rather than polling. Security defaults include bearer token auth, Zod validation, and path traversal protection. There's a live demo you can try before installing anything.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Task planning flow**: AI asks questions before starting work, so agents get precise instructions</li>
<li>**Auto-creates agents**: Spawns specialized agents per task rather than throwing everything at one</li>
<li>**Live event feed**: Real-time stream of agent activity, task state changes, and system events</li>
<li>**Multi-machine support**: Run the dashboard on one box, the agents on another, over Tailscale</li>
<li>**SQLite storage**: No external database needed, resets with a single file delete</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crshdn/mission-control.git
cd mission-control
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL and OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN to .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4000`. The gateway token lives in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` under `gateway.token`.

**What it lacks**: No cost tracking, no memory file viewer. It's purely task-focused.

---

## 2. LobsterBoard — Best Custom Dashboard

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/Curbob/LobsterBoard" variant="solid" color="green" size="md" />

LobsterBoard takes a different approach from everything else on this list. Instead of a fixed layout, it's a drag-and-drop dashboard builder with 50 widgets. You decide what goes where. System stats, weather, RSS feeds, stock tickers, Claude API cost tracking, active session monitors. Pick what matters and arrange them however you want.

It runs as a single Node.js server with no framework and no build step. Drop it on a server, run `node server.cjs`, and you have a real-time dashboard that auto-refreshes via Server-Sent Events.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**50 widgets**: System monitoring, AI cost tracking, smart home, finance, media, and more</li>
<li>**Template gallery**: Export your layout, import others, share configurations</li>
<li>**Custom pages**: Add full pages beyond the widget grid: notes, kanban boards, anything</li>
<li>**OpenClaw-specific widgets**: Auth status, cron job status, active session monitor, token gauge</li>
<li>**No cloud**: Everything runs locally, config saves to a single JSON file</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
npm install lobsterboard
cd node_modules/lobsterboard
node server.cjs
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`, press **Ctrl+E** for edit mode, drag widgets from the sidebar, save.

**License note**: LobsterBoard uses Business Source License 1.1. Free for personal and non-commercial use, but commercial use needs a separate license from the author. Everything else on this list is MIT.

## 3. AI Maestro — Best for Large Agent Teams

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro" variant="solid" color="purple" size="md" />

AI Maestro comes from someone who was running 35 agents across multiple terminals and got tired of manually copying context between them. It's the most ambitious project here, built as a peer mesh network where multiple machines join as equal nodes with every agent visible from one dashboard.

The standout feature is the Agent Messaging Protocol (AMP), which lets agents send messages to each other directly rather than relying on you to relay context. It also includes a code graph (interactive codebase visualization), persistent memory across sessions, and Kanban-based work coordination.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Multi-machine mesh**: No central server; machines connect as peers and a new computer joins automatically</li>
<li>**Agent-to-agent messaging**: Agents coordinate directly using AMP, with priority levels and cryptographic signatures</li>
<li>**Works with any agent**: Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, Copilot — not locked to OpenClaw</li>
<li>**Gateway integrations**: Route agent interactions through Slack, Discord, Email, WhatsApp</li>
<li>**Three memory layers**: Conversation memory, code graph, auto-generated documentation</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/23blocks-OS/ai-maestro/main/scripts/remote-install.sh | sh
```

Dashboard opens at `http://localhost:23000`. Requires Node.js 18+ and tmux.

**When to use it**: If you're running 10+ agents and need them to coordinate without you acting as the go-between. Overkill for a single-agent setup.

---

## 4. Clawe — Best Multi-Agent Coordination

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/getclawe/clawe" variant="solid" color="blue" size="md" />

Clawe ships with a pre-configured squad of four agents: Clawe (Squad Lead), Inky (Content Editor), Pixel (Designer), and Scout (SEO). Each agent wakes on a 15-minute cron schedule, checks for assigned tasks, and reports back. A Convex backend stores tasks, notifications, and activity. The web dashboard gives you the squad status, task board, and direct chat with any agent.

It's more opinionated than the others. You're working within a defined team structure rather than building your own. Setup is faster, but customizing the squad takes more work.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Pre-configured squad**: Four agents with distinct roles, ready to work out of the box</li>
<li>**Heartbeat scheduling**: Agents wake every 15 minutes to check for work, staggered to avoid rate limits</li>
<li>**Kanban task board**: Assign tasks to specific agents, track subtasks and deliverables</li>
<li>**@mention notifications**: Tag an agent in a task and it gets notified on next wake</li>
<li>**Shared workspace files**: Agents coordinate through shared context files</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getclawe/clawe.git
cd clawe
cp .env.example .env
# Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SQUADHUB_TOKEN, CONVEX_URL
pnpm install
cd packages/backend && npx convex deploy
./scripts/start.sh
```

Dashboard runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

**What it requires**: A free Convex account for the backend. More moving parts than the other options, but the Convex free tier covers a personal setup comfortably.

## 5. Clawd Control — Best Lightweight Fleet Monitor

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/Temaki-AI/clawd-control" variant="solid" color="green" size="md" />

Clawd Control is deliberately minimal. Single Node.js server, no build step, no framework, vanilla HTML/JS throughout. It auto-discovers local OpenClaw agents, shows real-time health metrics via SSE, and lets you drill into any agent's sessions, channels, and config. Password auth with a randomly generated key on first run.

If you want something running in five minutes without thinking about it, this is it.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Auto-discovery**: Finds local OpenClaw agents without manual configuration</li>
<li>**Agent creation wizard**: Guided setup to spin up new agents from the dashboard</li>
<li>**Host metrics**: CPU, RAM, disk usage for the machine running OpenClaw</li>
<li>**Fleet overview**: All agents in one view with health indicators</li>
<li>**One dependency**: Only `ws` (WebSocket client), no framework or bundler</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Temaki-AI/clawd-control.git
cd clawd-control
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3100` and log in with the generated password printed to console.

---

## 6. VidClaw — Best Task + Soul Management

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/madrzak/vidclaw" variant="solid" color="purple" size="md" />

VidClaw focuses on what your agent is working on rather than the infrastructure around it. It has a Kanban board where tasks get assigned to specific OpenClaw skills, a soul editor for SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, and USER.md with version history, and usage tracking parsed directly from session transcripts.

The security model is simple: it binds to localhost only, and you access it over SSH tunnel. No auth layer needed because SSH is the auth layer.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Kanban board**: Tasks execute automatically via cron (every 2 min) or heartbeat (every 30 min)</li>
<li>**Soul editor**: Edit SOUL.md and other identity files with persona templates and version history</li>
<li>**Model switching**: Change Claude models directly from the dashboard, hot-reloads via config watcher</li>
<li>**Usage tracking**: Token usage and cost estimates parsed from actual session transcripts</li>
<li>**Skills manager**: View, enable/disable, and create custom skills from the UI</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
git clone https://github.com/madrzak/vidclaw.git dashboard
cd dashboard
./setup.sh
```

Access via SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 3333:localhost:3333 root@your-server`, then open `http://localhost:3333`.

---

## 7. OpenClaw Dashboard — Best Security-Hardened Option

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/tugcantopaloglu/openclaw-dashboard" variant="solid" color="blue" size="md" />

This is the most security-conscious dashboard on the list. It has PBKDF2 password hashing with 100,000 iterations, optional TOTP MFA (Google Authenticator compatible), rate limiting, HSTS, CSP headers, path traversal protection, and a full audit log. All of that with zero external dependencies: pure Node.js, no database, no framework.

Beyond security, it covers a lot of ground: session management, cost analysis, rate limit monitoring, memory file viewer, cron job management, Tailscale integration, and a live feed of agent messages.

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**TOTP MFA**: Optional two-factor auth compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password</li>
<li>**Zero dependencies**: Pure Node.js with no npm packages required</li>
<li>**Cost analysis**: Spending breakdowns by model, session, and time period</li>
<li>**Memory viewer**: Browse MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, and daily memory notes</li>
<li>**Cron management**: View, enable/disable, and manually trigger scheduled jobs</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tugcantopaloglu/openclaw-dashboard.git
cd openclaw-dashboard
node server.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:7000` and register an account on first launch.

<Notice type="info" title="Security Setup">
The first time you run it, a recovery token prints to the console. Save it — you'll need it if you forget your password. To enable MFA, go to Settings → Security → Enable MFA after logging in.
</Notice>

## 8. Claw Dashboard — Best Terminal-Style Monitor

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/spleck/claw-dashboard" variant="solid" color="green" size="md" />

If you live in the terminal and want something that looks like btop or htop rather than a web app, Claw Dashboard is the one. ASCII art logo, gradient colors, donut charts, progress bars, all rendered in your terminal using the `blessed` library. It auto-refreshes every two seconds and shows per-core CPU usage, memory gauges, GPU stats (Apple Silicon), top processes, and active OpenClaw sessions.

```bash
npm install -g claw-dashboard
clawdash
```

Supports macOS out of the box. Works on Linux. Keyboard controls: `q` to quit, `r` to refresh, `s` for settings.

**Best for**: Quick monitoring without opening a browser. Great for Mac Mini setups where you'd SSH in anyway.

---

## 9. Clawtrol — Best All-in-One Panel

<Button text="GitHub Repository" link="https://github.com/nachoiacovino/clawtrol" variant="solid" color="purple" size="md" />

Clawtrol packs the most features into a single dashboard: system overview, remote screen viewer with click interaction (useful for headless Mac Minis), full web terminal via ttyd, file browser, session viewer with live chat, Kanban board, memory browser, cron manager, and sub-agent monitor. Each module is optional; enable only what you need.

Four themes out of the box: Nova (cyberpunk), Midnight (minimal dark), Catppuccin (warm pastel), Solar (light).

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Remote screen**: View and click your headless Mac's screen from a browser tab</li>
<li>**Web terminal**: Full shell access via ttyd, no SSH client needed</li>
<li>**Modular**: Enable only the panels you actually use; unused modules don't load</li>
<li>**Four themes**: Proper theming with font choices, not just a color swap</li>
<li>**pm2 integration**: `clawtrol start/stop/status` commands for daemon management</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

```bash
npm install -g clawtrol
clawtrol init
cd clawtrol
clawtrol start
```

Opens at `http://localhost:4781`.

<Notice type="warning" title="No Built-in Auth">
Clawtrol has no authentication. The assumption is you'll access it over Tailscale or a trusted network. Don't expose port 4781 to the public internet.
</Notice>

## Best Picks by Use Case

<Tabs>
<Tab name="Full Control">

**Mission Control** is the pick if you want proper multi-agent orchestration with task planning. The AI clarification flow before task dispatch is genuinely useful. Agents get clearer instructions and make fewer wrong assumptions. It's actively maintained, MIT-licensed, and well-documented.

**AI Maestro** is the pick if you're running many agents across multiple machines and need them to communicate with each other. The AMP messaging protocol solves a real problem once you're past single-agent setups.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Custom Layout">

**LobsterBoard** if you want to build exactly the dashboard you need. The 50-widget library covers system stats, AI cost tracking, weather, smart home sensors, finance, and more. The template gallery means you can import a community layout if you don't want to start from scratch.

Keep the BSL-1.1 license in mind if this is for anything commercial.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Simple Deploy">

**Clawd Control** — clone, `npm install`, `npm start`, done. Auto-discovers your local agents, no config required for a standard setup.

**OpenClaw Dashboard** — single `node server.js` command, zero npm dependencies. TOTP MFA if you need to expose it over the network. The most security-complete option with the least setup friction.

</Tab>

<Tab name="Terminal Only">

**Claw Dashboard** — install with `npm install -g claw-dashboard`, run with `clawdash`. Looks like btop. Works where you're already SSH'd in.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Pairing dashboards with the right setup

A dashboard is only as useful as what it's monitoring. A few things worth having sorted before you install one.

If you're watching costs, an efficient model matters more than the dashboard UI. The [best open source models for OpenClaw](/best-opensource-models-for-openclaw/) guide covers GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.5, which together cost a fraction of Claude API. Most dashboards make the difference obvious once you switch.

Several dashboards show active tool calls in real time, which makes search integration worth setting up. The [DuckDuckGo OpenClaw search guide](/duckduckgo-openclaw-search/) walks through adding free web search with no API key.

If you're evaluating dashboards as part of deciding which agent platform to use, the [OpenClaw alternatives](/openclaw-alternatives/) roundup covers NanoClaw, IronClaw, and others that bring their own dashboard approaches.

If you haven't installed OpenClaw yet, the [OpenClaw setup guide](/clawdbot-setup-guide/) covers the full installation on Hetzner VPS or Mac Mini, including the gateway token most of these dashboards need.

<Accordion label="Frequently Asked Questions" group="faq" expanded="true">

**Do I need to pick just one dashboard?**

No. Several people run Mission Control for task creation alongside something lighter like Claw Dashboard for quick system checks. They access different parts of the OpenClaw gateway independently.

**Which dashboard works best on a Mac Mini?**

Clawtrol stands out here because of the remote screen viewer. You can see and click your headless Mac's display from a browser without setting up VNC. LobsterBoard is also good on Mac Mini since it runs as a background service and shows system stats in a browser tab.

**Are any of these dashboards official OpenClaw projects?**

No. All of them are community-built. Mission Control is the most widely used and most actively maintained, but none of them are endorsed or maintained by the OpenClaw team.

**What's the minimum setup for just monitoring costs?**

OpenClaw Dashboard (`tugcantopaloglu/openclaw-dashboard`) — single `node server.js`, no dependencies, cost analysis built in. Or LobsterBoard if you want cost tracking alongside other widgets.

**Can I use these dashboards with alternative agent platforms?**

AI Maestro is explicitly designed to work with any terminal-based AI agent, not just OpenClaw. Mission Control and the others are built specifically for OpenClaw's gateway API. If you're running something from the [OpenClaw alternatives](/openclaw-alternatives/) list, check whether the gateway protocol is compatible before installing a dashboard.

**Is LobsterBoard free for personal use?**

Yes. Business Source License 1.1 permits personal and non-commercial self-hosting. Commercial deployments need a separate license from the author.

**Which one should I try first?**

If you want to try one today: Clawd Control. Clone it, run `npm start`, it finds your agents automatically. If you want the best long-term option for managing work: Mission Control.

</Accordion>

Nine dashboards in roughly two years. The terminal still works fine, but having actual visibility into what your agent is doing overnight is better once you have it. You start noticing things you'd otherwise miss.

Start with whatever fits your scale. Most of these can run alongside each other without conflicts, so switching later isn't a big deal.

For everything else in the OpenClaw ecosystem: [setup guide](/clawdbot-setup-guide/), [model recommendations](/best-opensource-models-for-openclaw/), [free web search](/duckduckgo-openclaw-search/), and [alternative platforms](/openclaw-alternatives/).
