</Notice>

### Option 1: Factory.ai Droid CLI (Recommended)

Factory.ai Droid CLI is the best way to use BrightData MCP. You get 20-40 million free AI tokens monthly plus access to Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.

**Step 1: Sign up for Droid CLI**

<Button text="Get Droid CLI Free" link="https://go.bitdoze.com/droid-cli" variant="solid" color="blue" size="md" />

**Step 2: Configure BrightData MCP**

Create or edit `~/.factory/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brightdata-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@brightdata/mcp"],

```

Replace `your_brightdata_api_token_here` with your actual API token from BrightData.

**Step 3: Start using it**

Open terminal and run:
```bash
droid
```

Then simply ask your AI:
```
Search Amazon for "wireless headphones" and show me the top 5 products
with prices, ratings, and reviews.
```

The AI will use BrightData MCP to fetch real product data and present it to you.

### Option 2: Claude Code

Claude Code from Anthropic provides a streamlined MCP integration.

**Quick Install:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse brightdata "https://mcp.brightdata.com/sse?token=YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your BrightData API token.

**Verify installation:**

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see:
```
brightdata: https://mcp.brightdata.com/sse?token=xxxxx (SSE) - âœ“ Connected
```

## Practical Examples: Real-World Usage

### Example 1: Building Product Comparison Articles

**Goal:** Create a roundup article about wireless headphones with real Amazon data.

**Prompt for your AI:**
```
Search Amazon for "wireless noise cancelling headphones" and extract
the top 5 products. For each product, I need:
- Product name and model
- Current price
- Average rating and review count
- Key features
- Pros and cons from reviews

Format this as a comparison table.
```

The AI will use `web_data_amazon_product_search` to find products, then `web_data_amazon_product` and `web_data_amazon_product_reviews` to gather details.

**Result:** Complete product data ready for your affiliate article, fetched in seconds.

### Example 2: Competitor Research

**Goal:** Analyze a competitor's LinkedIn presence.

**Prompt:**
```
Extract information from this LinkedIn company profile:
https://www.linkedin.com/company/example-company

I need:
- Employee count
- Recent posts and engagement
- Company description
- Specialties
- Posted jobs
```

The AI uses `web_data_linkedin_company_profile`, `web_data_linkedin_posts`, and `web_data_linkedin_job_listings`.

**Result:** Complete competitive intelligence gathered automatically.

### Example 3: Social Media Content Research

**Goal:** Understand what content performs well in your niche.

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze these Instagram posts for engagement patterns:
[URLs to competitor Instagram posts]

For each post, extract:
- Like count
- Comment count
- Caption text
- Posting time
- Hashtags used
```

Uses `web_data_instagram_posts` to gather data across multiple posts.

**Result:** Data-driven insights into what content resonates with your audience.

### Example 4: Real Estate Market Analysis

**Goal:** Track properties in a specific area.

**Prompt:**
```
Extract listings from this Zillow search:
[Zillow search URL for your target area]

Show me:
- Property addresses
- Prices
- Square footage
- Bedrooms/bathrooms
- Days on market
```

Uses `web_data_zillow_properties_listing` for structured real estate data.

**Result:** Real estate market data for analysis or lead generation.

### Example 5: Automated Price Monitoring

**Goal:** Monitor competitor pricing across platforms.

**Prompt:**
```
Compare pricing for [Product Name] across:
- Amazon
- Walmart
- eBay
- Best Buy

For each, show current price, availability, and shipping info.
```

Uses multiple tools (`web_data_amazon_product`, `web_data_walmart_product`, `web_data_ebay_product`, `web_data_bestbuy_products`) to gather pricing.

**Result:** Real-time price comparison data for strategic decisions.

</Notice>

## Best Practices for BrightData MCP

### 1. Cache Results When Possible

Don't re-fetch data you already have. Store results locally:

```
Extract this Amazon product data and save it to a JSON file.
Only re-fetch if the file is older than 24 hours.
```

### 2. Batch Related Requests

Instead of multiple prompts, combine requests:

```
For these 10 Amazon product URLs:
[list of URLs]

Extract all product data in one batch and create a comparison table.
```

### 3. Use Specific Tools for Better Results

Rather than generic scraping, use platform-specific tools:

**Less efficient:**
```
Scrape data from this Amazon product page
```

**More efficient:**
```
Use web_data_amazon_product to extract structured data from this ASIN: B08XYZ123
```

### 4. Leverage Structured Data

When available, BrightData's structured data tools are faster and more reliable than scraping HTML:

- Amazon products â†’ `web_data_amazon_product`
- LinkedIn profiles â†’ `web_data_linkedin_person_profile`
- Instagram posts â†’ `web_data_instagram_posts`

### 5. Monitor Your Usage

Regularly check your request count:

```
Show me my BrightData MCP session stats
```

This helps you stay within free tier limits or optimize paid usage.

### 6. Set Reasonable Timeouts

Some data sources are slower than others. Set appropriate timeouts (180 seconds recommended) to avoid premature request cancellations.

### 7. Validate and Filter Data

Always treat scraped data as untrusted:

```
Extract product data from [URL] and validate that:
- Price is a number
- Rating is between 0-5
- Reviews count is reasonable
- Product name is not empty
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "spawn npx ENOENT" Error

**Problem:** System can't find the `npx` command.

**Solution:** Use full Node.js path in your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brightdata-mcp": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/node",
      "args": ["node_modules/@brightdata/mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Find your Node path with:
- **macOS/Linux:** `which node`
- **Windows:** `where node`

### Issue: Timeout Errors

**Problem:** Requests timing out before completing.

**Solution:** Increase timeout in your AI tool settings (recommended: 180 seconds minimum).

### Issue: Rate Limiting

**Problem:** Hitting rate limits too quickly.

**Solution:**
1. Implement request delays between batches
2. Cache results to avoid re-fetching
3. Upgrade to paid tier if needed

### Issue: Incomplete Data

**Problem:** Some fields missing from extracted data.

**Solution:**
- Use platform-specific tools instead of generic scraping
- Check if the webpage structure changed
- Verify the URL is accessible
- Try re-fetching after a short delay

### Issue: Authentication Required

**Problem:** Some pages require login to access.

**Solution:**
- For public data, ensure you're using the correct URL
- For private data, BrightData MCP cannot access password-protected content
- Consider using browser automation with authenticated sessions (advanced)
