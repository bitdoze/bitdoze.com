## Why $10/month Copilot Pro Beats Everything Else

Let me be direct: **GitHub Copilot Pro is the best value in AI coding today**. Here's why:

### Unlimited GPT-5 Mini (The Game Changer)

<ListCheck>

- **Completely free to use** - Doesn't count against your 300 premium requests
- **No daily limits** - Use it 24/7 for all your coding
- **Fast and capable** - Handles 90% of coding tasks perfectly
- **Available everywhere** - Works in Zed, VS Code, CLI, and Copilot Chat

</ListCheck>

Most of your daily coding—refactoring, writing functions, debugging, documentation—works great with GPT-5 mini. Save your 300 premium requests for the really complex stuff.

### Work Everywhere: One Subscription, Multiple Tools

The beauty of Copilot Pro is flexibility. Your $10 subscription works across:

<Tabs>
<Tab name="Zed IDE">

**The fastest, most modern option**

- Native macOS performance
- Instant AI suggestions
- Sleek, minimal interface
- Access to all Copilot models
- Perfect for serious developers

**Enable latest models**: Visit https://github.com/settings/copilot/features

</Tab>
<Tab name="VS Code">

**Most popular, feature-complete**

- Inline code suggestions
- Full Chat sidebar
- Edit mode and Agent mode
- Extensions ecosystem
- Works on all platforms

</Tab>
<Tab name="Terminal (CLI)">

**AI in your command line**

# Use interactively
copilot

# Or directly

```

Perfect for DevOps and terminal workflows.

</Tab>
<Tab name="Other IDEs">

**Also supported:**
- JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm)
- Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- Xcode
- Vim/Neovim

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 300 Premium Requests Go Further Than You Think

While unlimited GPT-5 mini handles daily tasks, you get 300 premium requests monthly for:

- **Complex algorithms** - Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 (1 request each)
- **Architecture decisions** - Get expert-level AI assistance
- **Code reviews** - Deep analysis of pull requests
- **Autonomous agents** - 1 request per complete PR creation

**Smart usage example:**
- 20 complex coding sessions with Claude Sonnet 4.5 = 20 requests
- 30 coding agent sessions (auto-create PRs) = 30 requests
- 50 CLI commands for complex tasks = 50 requests
- **Total: 100 requests used, 200 remaining**

## The Power of GitHub Copilot Pro

### 1. Code Completion in Your IDE

Real-time suggestions as you type:

<ListCheck>

- **Ghost text suggestions** appear inline as you code
- **Tab to accept** - Instant code completion
- **Multiple suggestions** - Cycle through alternatives
- **Context-aware** - Understands your entire project
- **Works offline cached** - Basic completions without internet

</ListCheck>

### 2. Copilot Chat: Your AI Pair Programmer

Available in all supported IDEs and on GitHub.com:

<Accordion label="What You Can Do with Chat" group="features">

**Ask questions:**
```
How do I implement authentication with JWT tokens in Express?
```

**Generate code:**
```
Create a React component for a pricing table with 3 tiers
```

**Refactor and improve:**
```
Refactor this function to use async/await instead of callbacks
```

**Debug issues:**
```
Why is this function returning undefined?
```

**Write tests:**
```
Generate unit tests for the UserService class
```

</Accordion>

### 3. Copilot CLI: Terminal-Based AI

The CLI is incredibly powerful for DevOps and terminal workflows:

<Accordion label="Local Development Tasks" group="cli">

```bash
# Make code changes
copilot -p "Add input validation to user-auth.js"

# Create new features
copilot -p "Create a REST API endpoint for user profiles"

# Git operations
copilot -p "Create a feature branch and commit current changes"

# Build apps from scratch
copilot -p "Create a Node.js CLI tool that analyzes log files"
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="GitHub Integration" group="cli">

```bash
# View your work
copilot -p "List all my open pull requests"

# Create issues
copilot -p "Create an issue for the login bug I found"

# Create PRs
copilot -p "Create a PR that updates the README"

# Review code
copilot -p "Review PR #123 and check for security issues"
```

</Accordion>

### 4. Coding Agents: Autonomous Development

This is where it gets really cool. Copilot can **autonomously write code and create pull requests** for you:

**From GitHub Issues:**
1. Open an issue
2. Assign it to @copilot
3. Copilot analyzes and codes
4. Creates a pull request

**From Chat:**
```
Create a PR that adds dark mode support to the app
```

Copilot will:
- Find relevant files
- Make necessary changes
- Test if possible
- Create the PR with description

<Notice type="info" title="My Real-World Experience">

I tested the [Copilot Agents infrastructure](https://github.com/copilot/agents) for hands-off automation with GitHub Actions.

**Result**: Not worth it. Cost ~$0.50 per request and didn't perform reliably. The manual agent approach through Chat or CLI works much better and is included in your $10 subscription.

**Best practice**: Use agents for well-defined tasks through Chat or CLI, review the changes, then approve. Works great this way.

</Notice>

Zed is a modern, incredibly fast IDE built by the creators of Atom. Combined with Copilot Pro, it's the ultimate development environment:

<ListCheck>
