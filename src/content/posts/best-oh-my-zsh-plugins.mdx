Oh My ZSH plugins add command suggestions, syntax highlighting, and shortcuts that speed up your terminal work.

If you spend any real time in the terminal, the right plugins make a noticeable difference. Here are the ones I actually use and recommend.

## Installation and Setup Guide

Getting Oh My ZSH running with plugins takes a few minutes:

<Accordion label="Installing Oh My ZSH" group="setup" expanded="true">
First, install Oh My ZSH using this simple command:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

The script handles the setup. Your terminal restarts with a new prompt when it finishes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Installing Plugins" group="setup">
Most plugins need to be installed manually before you can use them. Here's how:

**For custom plugins (like autosuggestions):**
```shell
# Navigate to the plugins directory
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins

# Clone the plugin repository
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions
```

**For built-in plugins:** These come pre-installed with Oh My ZSH and just need to be enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Enabling Plugins" group="setup">
Once installed, you need to activate plugins in your configuration file:

1. Open your `.zshrc` file:
```shell
nano ~/.zshrc
```

2. Find the plugins line and add your desired plugins:
```shell
plugins=(git npm node zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

3. Save the file and reload your terminal:
```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```
</Accordion>

<Notice type="info" title="Quick Tip">
Run `source ~/.zshrc` after changes to apply them without restarting.

## Tips

**Getting started:**
- Start with 5-10 plugins and add more as needed
- Test new plugins in a separate terminal first
- Remove plugins you don't use

**Performance:**
- 10-15 plugins is a reasonable limit
- If startup feels slow, disable plugins one by one to find the cause

<Notice type="warning" title="Performance">
Too many plugins slow down terminal startup. Keep only what you actually use.
</Notice>

**Troubleshooting:**
- Plugin not working? Check if it's in your plugins list
- Conflicts happen. Try disabling other plugins to isolate the issue

## Conclusion

Start with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting. Those two alone make a noticeable difference. Add more plugins as you need them.

Don't install everything at once. Try a plugin, use it for a week, and decide if it actually helps. Some plugins sound useful but end up unused.

The [official Oh My ZSH plugin repository](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins) has hundreds more options if you want to explore further.
