</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Set Up Your Code Repository
---
Before writing any code, create a GitHub repository. This gives you version control, backup, and enables automatic deployments.

### Create a GitHub Account

1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Set Up SSH Keys (Recommended)

SSH keys let you push code securely without entering passwords every time:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Start the ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the public key to GitHub:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → SSH and GPG keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Paste your public key
4. Save

For more details: [Link GitHub with SSH on Mac/Linux](https://www.bitdoze.com/link-github-with-ssh-maco-linux/)

### Create Your Repository

1. Click the "+" icon in GitHub
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name it (e.g., `my-first-ai-project`)
4. Keep it public or private (your choice)
5. Don't initialize with README (you'll create it locally)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Choose Your AI Coding Assistant
---
This is important. The right AI assistant makes the difference in your learning and building experience.

**When you're building seriously**: Upgrade to **GitHub Copilot Pro** ($10/month). The investment pays for itself in time saved within the first week.

## Step 4: Create Your Documentation Folder
---
This is important and most beginners skip it. A well-maintained documentation folder helps AI understand your project and make better decisions.

### Why Documentation Matters

AI is powerful, but it doesn't automatically know:
- How your specific project is structured
- What commands to run for testing
- What conventions you're following
- What libraries and versions you're using

With clear documentation, your AI assistant provides help tailored to your project.

### Create a `docs/` Folder

In your project root, create a `docs` folder with these files:

```bash
mkdir docs
```

### Essential Documentation Files

#### 1. Framework Documentation

If you're using Astro, create `docs/astro.md`:

```markdown
# Astro Framework Guide

## Installation & Setup
npm create astro@latest

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start dev server (http://localhost:4321)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Project Structure
- `src/pages/` - File-based routing
- `src/layouts/` - Reusable page layouts
- `src/components/` - React/Vue/Svelte components
- `src/content/` - Markdown content collections
- `public/` - Static assets

## Key Concepts
- Islands Architecture - Only hydrate interactive components
- Content Collections - Type-safe markdown content
- Zero JS by default - Ship less JavaScript

## Common Patterns
- Use `---` frontmatter for component scripts
- Import components: `import Header from '../components/Header.astro'`
- Access props: `const { title } = Astro.props`
```

#### 2. Stack-Specific Guides

For TanStack Start, create `docs/tanstack-start.md`:

```markdown
# TanStack Start Guide

## Project Structure
- `src/routes/` - File-based routing
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/server/` - Server-side functions
- `src/lib/` - Utilities and helpers

## Key Features
- Server functions with `createServerFn()`
- Type-safe routing
- Built-in data loading
- SSR and SSG support

## Backend Options
- Convex - Serverless backend
- Drizzle + PostgreSQL - Traditional database
- Supabase - Backend as a service
```

#### 3. Styling Documentation

Create `docs/tailwind.md` if using Tailwind CSS:

```markdown
# Tailwind CSS v4 Guide

## Configuration
- CSS-first config using `@theme` directive
- No more `tailwind.config.js` needed

## Common Patterns
- Use utility classes: `bg-blue-500 text-white p-4`
- Responsive: `sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl`
- Dark mode: `dark:bg-gray-800`
- Hover states: `hover:bg-blue-600`

## Custom Theme
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary-500: #3b82f6;
  --font-sans: 'Inter', sans-serif;
}
```


### Example: Complete Project Documentation

Here's what good documentation looks like. This is from my TanStack project [bitbuddies.me](https://bitbuddies.me/):

```markdown
# Project Overview

## Tech Stack
- Framework: TanStack Start (React 19)
- Backend: Convex
- Auth: Clerk
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- Type Safety: TypeScript strict mode

## Commands
- `bun run dev` - Development server (port 3000)
- `bun run build` - Production build
- `bun run test` - Run tests
- `bun convex dev` - Start Convex backend

## Code Conventions
- Use React Server Components by default
- Client components must have 'use client' directive
- Keep server functions in `src/server/`
- Use Zod for validation
- Follow existing file naming patterns

## Important Notes
- Always run tests before committing
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Database schema changes require migration
- Environment variables go in `.env.local`
```

## Step 5: Use the AGENTS.md File
---
The `AGENTS.md` file is your AI assistant's instruction manual for your project. It tells the AI exactly how to work with your codebase.

### Create AGENTS.md in Your Root

```bash
touch AGENTS.md
```

### What to Include

Here's a template based on my production projects:

```markdown
# Agent Instructions

You don't need to create any documentation unless I specifically ask. Just provide short summaries of what you did.

## Commands

- **dev**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:4321)
- **build**: `npm run build`
- **test**: `npm test`

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Astro v5 static site generator
- **Content**: Markdown files in `src/content/posts/`
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Components**: Reusable components in `src/components/`

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing file naming conventions
- Use Tailwind utilities for styling
- Keep components simple and focused

## Important Notes

- Always test changes locally before committing
- Follow existing code patterns in similar files
- Check that all images exist before referencing them
- Run build to verify no errors

## Testing Workflow

1. Make changes
2. Run `npm run dev` to test locally
3. Run `npm run build` to check for errors
4. Review changes carefully
5. Commit with descriptive message

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't use libraries that aren't already installed
- Check TypeScript errors before committing
- Verify all imports are correct
- Test responsive design at different screen sizes
```

### Why This Matters

Without `AGENTS.md`, AI makes assumptions. With it, AI follows your project's specific patterns and conventions. This dramatically improves code quality and reduces errors.

## Step 6: Add MCP Servers to Your AI
---
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers give your AI superpowers by connecting it to external services and tools.

### What Are MCP Servers?

MCP servers extend what your AI can do. Instead of just writing code, your AI can:
- Search the web for current information
- Access up-to-date framework documentation
- Test your application automatically
- Interact with databases and APIs

### Essential MCP Servers for Beginners

#### 1. Context7 - Up-to-Date Documentation

Context7 provides fresh documentation for frameworks and libraries. Instead of AI using outdated training data, it fetches current docs.

**What it helps with:**
- Latest API references
- Current best practices
- Recent framework updates
- New features and deprecations

#### 2. BrightData MCP - Web Search & Data

BrightData MCP lets your AI search the web and extract data from websites. Perfect for research and gathering information.

**What it helps with:**
- Searching for solutions to problems
- Finding examples and tutorials
- Researching competitors
- Gathering data for your project

Learn more: [BrightData MCP Guide](https://www.bitdoze.com/brightdata-mcp-guide/)

#### 3. Playwright MCP - Application Testing

Playwright MCP enables your AI to test your application automatically by controlling a browser.

**What it helps with:**
- Testing user workflows
- Verifying forms work correctly
- Checking responsive design
- Catching bugs before deployment

GitHub: [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)

### How to Add MCP Servers

The setup process depends on your AI tool. Here's how to do it for popular options:

<Accordion label="Droid CLI / Factory.ai" group="mcp">

Create or edit `~/.factory/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brightdata-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your_brightdata_token"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Cursor IDE" group="mcp">

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Tools & Integrations
3. Add Custom MCP
4. Paste configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brightdata-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "your_brightdata_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Windsurf" group="mcp">

Similar to Cursor - add to MCP configuration in settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</Accordion>

### Don't Overdo It

<Notice type="warning" title="Keep It Simple">

Start with just 2-3 MCP servers. Too many can overwhelm the AI and actually reduce performance. Add more only when you have a specific need.

**Recommended starter set:**
- Context7 (documentation)
- BrightData MCP (web search)
- That's it!

</Notice>

For a complete list of available MCP servers, visit: [mcpservers.org](https://mcpservers.org/)

## Step 7: Start Building Features Incrementally
---
This is where most beginners make mistakes. They try to build everything at once, overwhelming both themselves and the AI.

### Think Small and Focused

Break your project into tiny, manageable features. Instead of "build a blog," think:

1. Create the homepage layout
2. Add a navigation menu
3. Create a single blog post page
4. Add a blog post listing page
5. Implement search functionality
6. Add categories and tags

### Create a Project Architecture First

Before writing code, ask your AI to help plan the structure:

**Good prompt:**
```
I want to build a personal blog with Astro. It should have:
- Homepage with recent posts
- Individual post pages
- About page
- Contact form
- Categories and tags

Please create a project architecture document that outlines:
- Folder structure
- Key components needed
- Content organization
- Routing approach

Don't write code yet, just plan the structure.
```

This gives you a roadmap and helps you understand what you're building.

### Work on One Feature at a Time

When building, focus on a single feature completely before moving on:

**Bad approach:**
```
Build the homepage, blog pages, contact form, and about page
```

**Good approach:**
```
Create the homepage layout with:
- Header with site title and navigation
- Hero section with welcome message
- Grid of latest 3 blog posts
- Footer with copyright

Use Tailwind for styling and make it responsive.
```

### Example: Building a Blog Post Page

Here's how to approach a single feature step by step:

**Step 1: Create the basic page structure**
```
Create a blog post page template at src/pages/blog/[slug].astro
- It should accept a slug parameter
- Display post title, date, and author
- Render markdown content
- Use the main layout
```

**Step 2: Add styling**
```
Style the blog post page:
- Use Tailwind typography plugin for content
- Add a max-width container
- Style the header with gradient
- Make code blocks look good
```

**Step 3: Add metadata**
```
Add SEO metadata to the blog post template:
- Title tag with post title
- Meta description from frontmatter
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Canonical URL
```

**Step 4: Test and refine**
```
Test the blog post page with different content:
- Long posts with many headings
- Posts with images
- Posts with code blocks
- Short posts
```

Each step is focused and manageable. AI can handle these easily without getting confused.

### Keep the AI Focused

If you notice the AI starting to add features you didn't ask for, rein it back:

```
That's good, but I only asked for the header right now.
Let's finish the header completely before moving to other sections.
Can you remove the footer and sidebar code and focus only on the header?
```

## Step 8: Review and Understand Every Line of Code
---
This is crucial for learning. Don't just accept code from AI without understanding it.

### Ask for Explanations

After AI generates code, ask it to explain:

**Good follow-up prompts:**
```
Explain what this component does line by line

Why did you use this approach instead of [alternative]?

What are the potential issues with this code?

How would I modify this to add [feature]?
```

### Request Comments

For complex code, ask AI to add explanations:

```
Add comments to this code explaining what each section does.
Focus on the "why" not just the "what."
```

### Identify Learning Opportunities

When you see something you don't understand:

```
I don't understand this TypeScript syntax: `const { data }: { data: Post[] }`
Can you explain what this means and why we use it?
```

### Keep a Learning Log

Create a `LEARNING.md` file in your project:

```markdown
# Things I've Learned

## TypeScript Destructuring
```typescript
const { title, date } = post;
```
This extracts specific properties from an object. More concise than:
```typescript
const title = post.title;
const date = post.date;
```

## Component Props in Astro
Props are passed to components and accessed via `Astro.props`:
```astro
---
const { title } = Astro.props;
---
<h1>{title}</h1>

## Tailwind Responsive Classes
`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes apply styles at breakpoints:
- `sm:` = 640px and up
- `md:` = 768px and up
- `lg:` = 1024px and up
```

This log becomes your personal reference as you learn.

## Step 9: Get a Second Opinion
---
AI can make mistakes or use suboptimal approaches. Getting a second AI's perspective catches issues early.

### Use a Different AI for Code Review

If you built features with Claude Sonnet 4.5, ask GPT-5 to review. If you used GPT-5, ask Claude to review.

**Code review prompt:**
```
Please review this [component/feature/file] for:

1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance issues
3. Code quality and maintainability
4. Potential bugs
5. Best practice violations

Be thorough and critical. I want to improve this code.
```

### Create a Review Document

Ask the second AI to create `REVIEW.md`:

```
After reviewing the entire codebase, create a REVIEW.md file with:

## Security Issues
List any security concerns found

## Performance Optimizations
Suggest improvements for speed and efficiency

## Code Quality
Note areas that could be cleaner or more maintainable

## Best Practices
Identify where we deviate from best practices

## Recommended Changes
Prioritized list of improvements

Be specific with file names and line numbers where relevant.
```

### Iterate Based on Feedback

Don't just collect feedback—act on it:

```
Based on the review, let's fix the top 3 security issues first.
Start with [specific issue from review].
```

### Example Review Process

Here's what a typical review session looks like:

1. **Build feature with AI #1** (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.5)
2. **Switch to AI #2** (e.g., GPT-5) and share the code
3. **Request detailed review** focusing on security and performance
4. **Review the feedback** and ask questions about anything unclear
5. **Prioritize fixes** starting with security issues
6. **Implement improvements** with AI #1
7. **Verify fixes** with AI #2

This back-and-forth catches issues that a single AI might miss.

## Step 10: Deploy Your Project
---
Time to make your project live! Deployment gets your work on the internet for others to use.

### Push to GitHub

First, make sure all your changes are committed:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial project setup with homepage and blog"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Get a Domain Name (Optional)

While you can use free subdomains, a custom domain looks more professional:

**Where to buy domains:**
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) - $1-15/year
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) - At-cost pricing
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) - Low prices, good service

Choose a `.com` if available, or `.dev` for tech projects.

### Set Up Alerts

Configure notifications for critical issues:

**Essential alerts:**
<ListCheck>

- Site is down (uptime monitor)
- Deployment failed (hosting platform)
- JavaScript errors spike (Sentry)
- Server resources high (server monitoring)

</ListCheck>

**Where to send alerts:**
- Email (always)
- Slack/Discord (for teams)
- SMS (critical issues only)
- PagerDuty (on-call scenarios)

### Regular Health Checks

Weekly or monthly, manually check:

<ListCheck>

- Uptime percentage (should be >99%)
- Error rate (should be low and stable)
- Page load times (should be fast)
- Failed deployments (investigate causes)
- Security updates needed (dependencies)

</ListCheck>

## Step 12: Continue Adding Features Carefully
---
Your project is live! Now you'll iterate and improve. But do it carefully to avoid breaking what works.

### Always Work on a Branch

Never commit directly to `main` when your site is live:

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode

# Make your changes and test locally

# Commit to the branch
git add -A
git commit -m "Add dark mode toggle"

# Push the branch
git push origin feature/add-dark-mode
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub and deploy from there.

### Test Locally First

Before deploying new features:

<ListCheck>

1. **Run the dev server** - `npm run dev`
2. **Test the new feature** thoroughly
3. **Check existing features** still work
4. **Test on mobile** sizes
5. **Run the build** - `npm run build`
6. **Fix any errors** that appear
7. **Preview the build** - `npm run preview`

</ListCheck>

Only after all these checks pass should you deploy.

### Use Staging Environments

For serious projects, have a staging site:

**Setup:**
1. Create a separate branch (e.g., `staging`)
2. Deploy it to a different URL (e.g., `staging.yourdomain.com`)
3. Test new features on staging first
4. Merge to `main` only after verification

Most hosting platforms make this easy:
- Vercel: Automatic preview deployments for branches
- Cloudflare Pages: Can deploy multiple branches
- Self-hosted: Use Dokploy to deploy multiple branches

### Keep Features Small

Remember Step 7? This applies forever:

**Bad:**
```
Add user authentication, profile pages, and social sharing all at once
```

**Good:**
```
Step 1: Add user registration form with email/password
Step 2: Add login functionality
Step 3: Add password reset flow
Step 4: Add email verification
```

Small changes are easier to test, debug, and roll back if needed.

### Document New Features

Update your `AGENTS.md` when adding new patterns:

```markdown
## Recent Additions

### Dark Mode (Added 2025-11-10)
- Theme toggle in header
- Saved to localStorage
- CSS variables in `theme.css`
- Usage: Add `dark:` prefix to Tailwind classes

### User Authentication (Added 2025-11-08)
- Using Clerk for auth
- Protected routes in `src/middleware/auth.ts`
- User object available in `Astro.locals.user`
```

This helps AI (and future you) understand the full project context.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Overwhelming the AI

**Symptom:** AI generates buggy code or misses requirements

**Solution:** Break tasks into smaller pieces. If AI is struggling, your request is too big.

### Pitfall 2: Not Testing Locally

**Symptom:** Deployments fail or bugs appear in production

**Solution:** Always run `npm run dev` and `npm run build` locally first.

### Pitfall 3: Trusting AI Blindly

**Symptom:** Accumulating technical debt or security issues

**Solution:** Review all code, ask questions, get second opinions.

### Pitfall 4: Too Many Dependencies

**Symptom:** Project becomes slow, bloated, or breaks easily

**Solution:** Only add libraries when necessary. Prefer solutions with fewer dependencies.

### Pitfall 5: No Version Control Discipline

**Symptom:** Lost code, unclear what changed, hard to roll back

**Solution:** Commit often with descriptive messages. Use branches for features.

### Pitfall 6: Ignoring Performance

**Symptom:** Slow load times, poor user experience

**Solution:** Test with Lighthouse, optimize images, minimize JavaScript.

### Pitfall 7: Skipping Documentation

**Symptom:** AI makes wrong assumptions, you forget how things work

**Solution:** Keep `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` updated. Document as you build.


## Real-World Success Example

Let me share my experience to show what's possible.

### The Project: SmoothieBlenderGuide.com

I recently rebuilt my affiliate site [SmoothieBlenderGuide.com](https://www.smoothieblenderguide.com/) from scratch using AI.

**Starting Point:**
- 40 articles on WordPress
- Slow performance (3-4 second load times)
- $15/month hosting
- Outdated product information

**Goal:**
- Migrate to Astro for speed
- Update all product data from Amazon
- Improve article quality
- Reduce hosting costs to $0

**Tools Used:**
- Factory.ai Droid CLI (40M free tokens)
- BrightData MCP (for Amazon data)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (for article writing)

**Process:**
1. Asked AI to create project architecture
2. Set up Astro with Tailwind CSS
3. Used BrightData MCP to fetch current Amazon data
4. Rewrote articles with updated information
5. Created comparison tables from review data
6. Generated optimized images
7. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages

**Results:**
- **40 articles completed** in ~3 hours of actual work
- **Total cost:** Under $2 (mostly AI tokens)
- **Hosting:** $0 (free on Cloudflare Pages)
- **Load times:** Under 1 second (from 3-4 seconds)
- **Better content:** More detailed with current data

**Key Takeaway:** With AI and the right approach, you can build professional-quality projects as a beginner.
