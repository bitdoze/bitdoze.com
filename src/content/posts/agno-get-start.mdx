### **Step 1: Turbocharge Your Setup with uv—Python Management at Warp Speed**

Before we unleash Agno’s powers, we need a lightning-fast foundation. That’s where **uv** comes in—a package manager from the Astral crew (the same folks behind `ruff`) that’s so quick, it’ll have you wondering why you ever tolerated `pip`’s leisurely pace. Let’s get it rolling!

You can check more on [how you can get started with uv](https://www.bitdoze.com/uv-get-start/)

#### **Installing uv**
For macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

Check it’s alive:

```bash
uv --version  # Expect "uv 0.6.6" or newer
```

#### **Initializing a Project**
Time to kick off your Agno adventure:

```bash
uv init agno-adventure
cd agno-adventure
```

This whips up a tidy project structure: `pyproject.toml` for dependencies, `.python-version` (set to 3.12 by default), `main.py` to code in, and a `README.md` for bragging rights. Lock in Python 3.12 for consistency:

```bash
uv python pin 3.12
```

#### **Setting Up the Environment**
Now, create a virtual environment faster than you can blink:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

Load up the essentials for our AI escapade:

```bash
uv add agno lancedb duckduckgo-search openai sqlalchemy psycopg-binary tantivy pypdf pandas
```

Agno needs an OpenAI API key to flex its muscles, so set it up:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

**Pro Tip:** Keep your keys safe in a `.env` file with `python-dotenv`. Run `uv add python-dotenv`, then add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here` to `.env` and load it in your script with `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()`. Security first, chaos later!

**Why uv?** It’s not just fast—it’s a one-stop shop replacing `pip`, `venv`, and more, with a sleek workflow that saves you from dependency nightmares. Think of it as the turbo engine powering your Agno rocket.


### **Step 2: Your First Agno Agent—Simple, Yet Chatty**

Let’s meet **Agno**, the star of our show. It’s an open-source Python library that makes building AI agents as easy as ordering takeout—but way more fun. Our first agent? A cheerful chatterbox ready to brighten your day.

#### **The Code**
Edit `main.py`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You’re a cheerful AI pal who loves a good chat!",
    markdown=True
)

agent.print_response("Hey! What’s cooking today?", stream=True)
```

Run it:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

#### **How It Works**
- **`Agent`**: The heart of Agno, this class is your agent’s command center, letting you define its personality and powers.
- **`OpenAIChat`**: Plugs into OpenAI’s `gpt-4o` model—think of it as the brain giving your agent its wit. Swap in other models (like `gpt-3.5-turbo`) if you’re feeling experimental!
- **`description`**: Sets the vibe. Here, we’ve got a peppy pal who’s all about good vibes.
- **`markdown=True`**: Spices up responses with formatting—because plain text is so 2024.
- **`print_response`**: Streams the reply in real-time, like watching your agent think out loud.

You’ll get a response like, “Hey there! Just here to spice up your day—what’s on the menu?” It’s basic, but it’s alive!

#### **More About Agno**
Agno’s lightweight design means it’s nimble yet powerful, perfect for crafting agents that scale from simple chats to complex tasks. Unlike heavier frameworks, it’s built for speed and flexibility, letting you add features like tools and memory without breaking a sweat.

#### **Troubleshooting**
- **“ModuleNotFoundError”**: Forgot a package? Run `uv add agno openai` and try again.
- **Silent Agent**: Check your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. No key, no chat—it’s like forgetting to plug in your coffee maker.



### **Step 3: Adding DuckDuckGo Tools—Your Web-Surfing Sidekick**

Our agent’s charming but clueless about the world. Let’s hook it up with **DuckDuckGo** tools so it can surf the web like a pro.

#### **The Code**
Update `main.py`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You’re a web-savvy AI explorer!",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

agent.print_response("What’s the buzz in New York, March 2025?", stream=True)
```

Run it:

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

#### **How It Works**
- **`DuckDuckGoTools`**: Equips your agent with a web search superpower. It decides when to use it based on the question—smart, right?
- **`show_tool_calls=True`**: Lets you peek at when the agent calls its tools, like a behind-the-scenes director’s cut.
- **Output**: Expect something like, “*Calling DuckDuckGo…* Here’s the latest from NYC in March 2025!” It’s now a worldly conversationalist.

#### **Agno’s Tool Power**
Agno’s tool system is modular brilliance. `DuckDuckGoTools` is just one option—Agno supports a growing toolbox you can mix and match to suit your needs, from APIs to custom scripts. It’s like giving your agent a utility belt!

#### **Troubleshooting**
- **No Web Results**: Ensure `duckduckgo-search` is in your arsenal—run `uv add duckduckgo-search`.
- **Stuck?**: Rate limits might be the culprit. Take a breather and retry. Add `debug_mode=True` to the `Agent` for a deeper look at what’s tripping it up.


### **Step 4: Memory That Sticks—From Forgetful to Faithful**

Our agent’s got charisma but forgets everything the moment you blink. Let’s give it a memory upgrade with Agno’s **SQLite-backed storage**, turning it into a loyal companion.

#### **The Code**
Create `memory_agent.py`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.storage.agent.sqlite import SqliteAgentStorage
from rich.pretty import pprint

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You’re an AI with a memory like an elephant!",
    storage=SqliteAgentStorage(table_name="agent_sessions", db_file="tmp/agent_storage.db"),
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    num_history_responses=3,
    session_id="my_chat_session",
    markdown=True
)

agent.print_response("I love spicy Thai food. What’s your favorite cuisine?")
pprint([m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"}) for m in agent.memory.messages])

agent.print_response("What did I just say I love?")
pprint([m.model_dump(include={"role", "content"}) for m in agent.memory.messages])
```

Run it:

```bash
uv run python memory_agent.py
```

#### **How It Works**
- **`SqliteAgentStorage`**: Saves chat history to a SQLite database (`tmp/agent_storage.db`), so your agent remembers even after a reboot.
- **`add_history_to_messages=True`**: Feeds the last few messages (set by `num_history_responses=3`) into the prompt, giving context.
- **`session_id`**: Links interactions under one session—use the same ID, and it’s like picking up where you left off.
- **`pprint`**: Debugging gold—shows what’s in memory after each chat.

Ask about Thai food, then test its recall. It’ll proudly declare, “You love spicy Thai food!” Memory unlocked!

#### **Agno’s Memory Magic**
Agno offers multiple memory types:
- **Chat History**: Every message, stored in `agent.memory.messages`.
- **User Memories**: Specific tidbits (like preferences), persisted via storage.
- **Summaries**: Condensed versions of long chats for efficiency.
This flexibility makes Agno ideal for agents that need to learn and grow with you.

#### **Troubleshooting**
- **Amnesia**: Same `session_id`? Check `tmp/` exists (create it with `mkdir tmp` if needed).
- **No Storage**: Run `uv add sqlalchemy`—it’s the backbone of SQLite storage.

**Pro Tip:** For big projects, swap `SqliteAgentStorage` for `PostgresAgentStorage` via `uv add psycopg-binary`. More power, same simplicity!

### **Step 5: RAG with LanceDB—Knowledge Is Your Superpower**

Time to make your agent a **Thai cuisine expert** with **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Using LanceDB, it’ll pull recipes from PDFs and back them up with web smarts—interactive style!

#### **The Code**
Create `rag_agent.py`:

```python
import typer
from rich.prompt import Prompt

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb
from agno.vectordb.search import SearchType
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# LanceDB Vector DB
vector_db = LanceDb(
    table_name="recipes",
    uri="tmp/lancedb",
    search_type=SearchType.hybrid
)

# Knowledge Base
knowledge_base = PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
    urls=["https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf"],
    vector_db=vector_db
)

def lancedb_agent(user: str = "user"):
    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        description="You’re a Thai cuisine expert with web backup!",
        user_id=user,
        knowledge=knowledge_base,
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        instructions=[
            "Search the knowledge base for Thai recipes first.",
            "Use DuckDuckGo if more info is needed."
        ],
        show_tool_calls=True,
        debug_mode=True,
        markdown=True
    )

    print(f"Session ID: {agent.session_id}\n")

    while True:
        message = Prompt.ask(f"[bold] :sunglasses: {user} [/bold]")
        if message in ("exit", "bye"):
            break
        agent.print_response(message, stream=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load once, comment out after first run
    knowledge_base.load(recreate=True)
    typer.run(lancedb_agent)
```

Run it:

```bash
uv run python rag_agent.py
```

#### **How It Works**
- **`LanceDb`**: A vector database storing PDF embeddings for lightning-fast retrieval. `SearchType.hybrid` blends keyword and semantic searches for max accuracy.
- **`PDFUrlKnowledgeBase`**: Loads a Thai recipe PDF into the database, fueling RAG—your agent fetches answers from it first.
- **`DuckDuckGoTools`**: Web fallback when the PDF isn’t enough.
- **`typer`/`Prompt`**: Keeps the chat going until you say “bye”—perfect for recipe hunting!
- **Output**: Ask, “How do I make chicken and galangal coconut soup?” It’ll dig into the PDF, then surf the web if needed.

#### **Agno’s RAG Edge**
RAG combines retrieval (from LanceDB) with generation (via `gpt-4o`), making your agent a knowledge ninja. Agno’s integration is seamless—add any document, and it’s instantly searchable. Plus, it’s fast enough to keep up with your hunger pangs!

#### **Troubleshooting**
- **PDF Won’t Load**: Verify the URL and `uv add lancedb`.
- **No Chat Prompt**: Add `uv add typer rich` for the interactive goodies.
- **Slow Start**: Comment out `knowledge_base.load(recreate=True)` after the first run—it only needs to build the database once.

**Pro Tip:** Toss more PDFs into `urls`—think cookbooks, travel guides, whatever—to create a custom knowledge empire.


### **Step 6: Team of Two—Chef and Researcher Duo**

Why stop at one agent when you can have a **dynamic duo**? Let’s pair a Thai chef with a web researcher for a collab that’s pure magic.

#### **The Code**
Create `team_agent.py`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.storage.agent.sqlite import SqliteAgentStorage

# Chef Agent
chef = Agent(
    name="ThaiChef",
    role="Thai cuisine expert",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    knowledge=PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
        urls=["https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf"],
        vector_db=LanceDb(
            uri="tmp/lancedb",
            table_name="recipes",
            search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
            embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small")
        )
    ),
    instructions=["Provide detailed Thai recipes from the knowledge base."],
    markdown=True
)

# Researcher Agent
researcher = Agent(
    name="WebResearcher",
    role="Web info gatherer",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=["Search the web for supplementary info when asked."],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Team Leader
team = Agent(
    team=[chef, researcher],
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You coordinate a chef and researcher for Thai food queries.",
    instructions=[
        "Ask ThaiChef for recipes first.",
        "If more context is needed, consult WebResearcher.",
        "Blend their inputs into a cohesive answer."
    ],
    storage=SqliteAgentStorage(table_name="team_sessions", db_file="tmp/team_storage.db"),
    markdown=True
)

chef.knowledge.load()  # Comment out after first run
team.print_response("Tell me about Thai chicken soup and its cultural significance.", stream=True)
```

Run it:

```bash
uv run python team_agent.py
```

#### **How It Works**
- **`ThaiChef`**: Recipe guru, pulling from the PDF via LanceDB with `OpenAIEmbedder` for precise embeddings.
- **`WebResearcher`**: Web sleuth, digging up cultural context with DuckDuckGo.
- **`team`**: The maestro, coordinating both agents and weaving their answers together. SQLite storage keeps the team’s memory sharp across sessions.
- **Output**: You’ll get a recipe *and* a story—like, “This soup’s a Thai staple, tied to ancient herbal traditions!”

#### **Agno’s Team Spirit**
Agno’s multi-agent system is a game-changer. Each agent has a role, tools, and knowledge, while the team leader delegates like a pro. It’s lightweight yet robust, designed to scale without bogging down—perfect for complex tasks.

#### **Troubleshooting**
- **Team Mute**: Add `debug_mode=True` to the team `Agent` to spy on the chatter.
- **Storage Snag**: Ensure the `SqliteAgentStorage` import is there and `tmp/` exists.
- **Slow Load**: Comment out `chef.knowledge.load()` after the first run.

**Pro Tip:** Add a third agent—like a spice specialist—to turn your duo into a trio of culinary geniuses.
