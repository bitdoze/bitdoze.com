**Total time: Under 2 minutes**

The cooling pad ensures the SSD stays at optimal temperatures even during intensive file transfers.

## Real-World Performance Testing

### Display Performance: Dual 4K Excellence

I tested the dock with two 4K monitors on both Mac systems:

#### MacBook M1 Pro
- **Monitor 1**: ASUS OLED 4K @ 144Hz
- **Monitor 2**: Standard 4K @ 60Hz
- **Result**: Flawless performance, no stuttering or lag

#### Mac Mini M4 Pro
- **Monitor 1**: ASUS OLED 4K @ 165Hz (pushed to maximum)
- **Monitor 2**: Standard 4K @ 60Hz
- **Result**: Perfect stability, smooth rendering

<Notice type="info" title="Display Compatibility">
The DC510 supports up to three 4K displays at 144Hz with DSC (Display Stream Compression) enabled on compatible devices. For dual 8K @60Hz, your laptop must support DSC with 3:1 compression ratio.
</Notice>

### SSD Performance: Impressive Speeds

I added a [WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe](https://amzn.to/3WoV1vu) to test the dock's storage capabilities.

  </ul>
</ListCheck>

## What Could Be Better

While the DC510 is excellent, there are some areas for improvement:

### Active Cooling Noise

The most significant drawback is the **active cooling fan**. Here's what I experienced:

- **With 1 monitor**: Fan starts spinning intermittently
- **With 2 monitors**: Fan runs more frequently
- **During file transfers**: Fan clearly audible
- **Noise level**: Noticeable in quiet office environments

**Comparison**: On the Mac Mini M4 Pro with Thunderbolt 5, the cooler doesn't start as frequently, suggesting the DC510's cooling curve is quite aggressive.

<Notice type="warning" title="Cooling Consideration">
If you work in a quiet environment or record audio/video, the fan noise may be distracting. Consider your use case and environment before purchasing.
</Notice>

### Limited Availability

Finding the DC510 in stock can be challenging. I had to order mine from a Greek retailer and wait a week for delivery to Romania. Check multiple retailers if you're interested.

### No 10GbE Option

While 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet is solid, power users with 10GbE networks might prefer the CalDigit TS5-Plus or similar docks with 10GbE support.

## Who Should Buy the ASUS DC510?

### Perfect For:

- **Content creators** working with 4K/8K video files
- **Photographers** who need fast SD card transfers
- **Developers** requiring multiple displays and fast storage
- **Mac users** with M1 Pro/Max/Ultra or M4 Pro/Max chips
- **Professionals** who want expandable storage in their dock

### Consider Alternatives If:

- You need absolute silence (look at passively cooled docks)
- You require 10 Gigabit Ethernet
- You're on a tight budget (check out Kensington SD5000T5)
- You prefer gaming-focused RGB (consider Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma)

## Final Thoughts

After a week of intensive testing, the **ASUS Master Thunderbolt 5 Dock DC510** has earned its place as one of the top Thunderbolt 5 docking stations available. The combination of excellent SSD performance, dual 4K monitor support at high refresh rates, and comprehensive connectivity makes it ideal for creative professionals and power users.

The real-world speeds I achieved with the WD_BLACK SN850X (5,800 MB/s read, 4,300 MB/s write) demonstrate the dock's ability to handle demanding workloads. The toolless SSD installation is elegant, and having expandable storage directly in your dock is incredibly convenient.

However, the active cooling noise is a legitimate concern. If you work in quiet environments or regularly record audio, this might be a dealbreaker. Otherwise, the ASUS DC510 offers excellent value for its €420 price tag.
