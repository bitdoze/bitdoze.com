In the era of data privacy and platform independence, self-hosting your newsletter platform gives you complete control over your subscriber data, email delivery, and costs. [Notifuse](https://www.notifuse.com/) is an open-source, self-hostable email platform that combines newsletter functionality with transactional email capabilities, making it a powerful alternative to services like Mailchimp, ConvertKit, or Listmonk.

In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through everything you need to know to get started with Notifuse and self-host your own newsletter platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

<ListCheck>
- **A VPS or Server**: At least 2GB RAM and 2 CPU cores recommended. You can use providers like Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or any VPS provider
- **A Domain Name**: For accessing your Notifuse instance (e.g., `newsletter.yourdomain.com`)
- **SMTP Provider**: For sending emails. Options include:
  - **Brevo** (formerly Sendinblue): Free tier with 300 emails/day
  - **Mail.Baby**: Pay-as-you-go pricing at $1/month + $0.20 per 1,000 emails

For testing and small newsletters, **Brevo's free tier** (300 emails/day) is perfect to get started. For production use with larger volumes, **Mail.Baby** offers excellent value with pay-as-you-go pricing, or **Amazon SES** for the absolute lowest cost at scale.
</Notice>

## Option 1: Deploy with Dokploy (Easiest Method)

Dokploy is an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that makes deploying applications incredibly easy. The best part? Dokploy has a **built-in Notifuse template** that handles all the configuration for you! If you haven't set up Dokploy yet, check out our comprehensive [Dokploy Installation Guide](https://www.bitdoze.com/dokploy-install/).

### Step 1: Set Up Dokploy

If you don't have Dokploy installed, follow these quick steps:

```sh
# Install Dokploy on your VPS
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

Access Dokploy at `http://your-vps-ip:3000` and complete the setup wizard.

### Step 2: Deploy from Template

1. Log in to your Dokploy dashboard
2. Click **"Create Project"** and give it a name (e.g., "Newsletter")
3. Inside the project, click **"Templates"**
4. Search for **"Notifuse"** in the template gallery
5. Click **"Deploy"** on the Notifuse template

### Step 3: Configure Template Variables

Dokploy will present you with a configuration form. Fill in the following:

**Required Configuration**:
- **Domain**: Your domain for Notifuse (e.g., `newsletter.yourdomain.com`)
- **Email**: Your root administrator email address
- **SMTP Host**: Your SMTP provider's host (e.g., `smtp-relay.brevo.com` for Brevo)
- **SMTP Port**: Usually `587` for STARTTLS
- **SMTP Username**: Your SMTP username
- **SMTP Password**: Your SMTP password
- **SMTP From Email**: The email address to send from (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)
- **SMTP From Name**: Your newsletter name (e.g., "My Newsletter")

**Security Keys** (Optional - uses default for testing):
- **PASETO Private Key**: Leave default or generate new keys at [paseto.notifuse.com](https://paseto.notifuse.com/)
- **PASETO Public Key**: Corresponding public key

<Notice type="info" title="PASETO Keys">
PASETO keys are used for authentication. The template includes default keys for testing, but you should generate your own for production at [https://paseto.notifuse.com/](https://paseto.notifuse.com/). Unlike SECRET_KEY in manual installs, these can be rotated if needed.
</Notice>

### Step 4: Configure DNS

Before deploying, make sure your domain's DNS is configured:

1. Go to your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Add an A record pointing to your VPS IP:
   - **Type**: A
   - **Name**: newsletter (or your subdomain)
   - **Value**: Your VPS IP address
   - **TTL**: 3600 (or Auto)

### Step 5: Deploy

1. Review your configuration
2. Click **"Deploy"**
3. Dokploy will:
   - Pull the Notifuse and PostgreSQL images
   - Configure the services
   - Set up SSL certificates automatically via Traefik
   - Start the application

4. Monitor the deployment in the logs tab
5. Once complete, access Notifuse at `https://newsletter.yourdomain.com`

<Notice type="success" title="Automatic SSL">
Dokploy automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt - no manual configuration needed!
</Notice>

### What the Template Includes

The Dokploy template automatically configures:

- **PostgreSQL 17** database with health checks
- **Notifuse** application connected to the database
- **Persistent volumes** for database and file storage
- **Environment variables** for all required configuration
- **Domain mapping** with automatic SSL/TLS
- **Port exposure** (8080 for web interface)
- **Restart policies** for high availability

## Option 2: Deploy with Docker Compose (Advanced Users)

If you prefer manual control or want to deploy without Dokploy, you can use Docker Compose directly. This method gives you more control but requires manual SSL setup.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Server

Update your system and install Docker:

```sh
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
```

### Step 2: Create Project Directory

```sh
# Create directory for Notifuse
mkdir -p ~/notifuse
cd ~/notifuse
```

### Step 3: Create Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```sh
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the following configuration:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    image: notifuse/notifuse:latest
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
      - '587:587'
    environment:
      # Server Configuration
      - SERVER_PORT=8080
      - SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
      - ENVIRONMENT=production

      # Database Configuration (Required)
      - DB_HOST=postgres
      - DB_PORT=5432
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - DB_PREFIX=notifuse
      - DB_NAME=notifuse_system
      - DB_SSLMODE=disable

      # PASETO Keys (Required) - Generate at https://paseto.notifuse.com/
      - PASETO_PRIVATE_KEY=${PASETO_PRIVATE_KEY}
      - PASETO_PUBLIC_KEY=${PASETO_PUBLIC_KEY}

      # All other settings can be configured through Setup Wizard
      # Or set them here:
      # - ROOT_EMAIL=${ROOT_EMAIL}
      # - API_ENDPOINT=${API_ENDPOINT}
      # - SMTP_HOST=${SMTP_HOST}
      # - SMTP_PORT=${SMTP_PORT}
      # - SMTP_USERNAME=${SMTP_USERNAME}
      # - SMTP_PASSWORD=${SMTP_PASSWORD}
      # - SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=${SMTP_FROM_EMAIL}
      # - SMTP_FROM_NAME=${SMTP_FROM_NAME}
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - notifuse-network

  postgres:
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - notifuse-network
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD-SHELL', 'pg_isready -U postgres']
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  postgres-data:
    driver: local

networks:
  notifuse-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Step 4: Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file:

```sh
nano .env
```

Add your configuration:

```env
# Database Password
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password_here

# PASETO Keys - Generate at https://paseto.notifuse.com/
PASETO_PRIVATE_KEY=your_paseto_private_key_here
PASETO_PUBLIC_KEY=your_paseto_public_key_here

# Optional: Configure SMTP here instead of Setup Wizard
# ROOT_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
# API_ENDPOINT=https://newsletter.yourdomain.com
# SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_USERNAME=your@email.com
# SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
# SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
# SMTP_FROM_NAME=My Newsletter
```

<Notice type="info" title="Generate PASETO Keys">
Visit [https://paseto.notifuse.com/](https://paseto.notifuse.com/) to generate secure PASETO key pairs. These are used for authentication instead of the older SECRET_KEY approach.
</Notice>

<Notice type="warning" title="Special Characters in .env Files">
If your passwords contain `#` characters, you **must** wrap them in quotes:

```env
DB_PASSWORD="mypass#word123"
SMTP_PASSWORD="pass#word123"
```

This is a limitation of `.env` file parsing.
</Notice>

### Step 5: Start Notifuse

```sh
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f api
```

### Step 6: Set Up Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

For production, you should use a reverse proxy with SSL. Install Nginx:

```sh
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

Create Nginx configuration:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/notifuse
```

Add this configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name newsletter.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and get SSL certificate:

```sh
# Enable site
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/notifuse /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

# Test configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Reload Nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d newsletter.yourdomain.com
```
