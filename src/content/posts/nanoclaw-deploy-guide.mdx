[NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) caught my attention because it takes a fundamentally different approach to security. Instead of application-level permission checks, it runs every agent in an actual Linux container. The agent can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash commands run inside the container, not on your host. It's also the first personal AI assistant to support [Agent Swarms](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) — teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks.

This guide walks through deploying NanoClaw on a VPS with WhatsApp integration, scheduled tasks, and proper container isolation.

## What NanoClaw actually is

NanoClaw is a lightweight alternative to OpenClaw that runs on Claude's Agent SDK. The key difference from other bots is the isolation model. Agents execute in Linux containers (Docker on Linux/macOS, Apple Container on macOS) with explicitly mounted directories. The agent can't escape the container, and it can only access what you allow.

The architecture looks like this:

```
WhatsApp (Baileys) --> SQLite --> Polling loop --> Container (Claude Agent SDK) --> Response
```

Single Node.js process. Per-group message queues. IPC via filesystem. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. The whole codebase is small enough to read in a single sitting.

### How it compares

| | OpenClaw | nanobot | NanoClaw 🐾 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language** | TypeScript | Python | **TypeScript** |
| **Isolation** | App-level | App-level | **Container-level** |
| **Agent SDK** | Custom | LiteLLM | **Claude Agent SDK** |
| **Agent Swarms** | No | No | **Yes (first)** |
| **Channels** | 4 platforms | 9 platforms | **WhatsApp** |
| **Setup** | Custom script | `pip install` | **Claude Code /setup** |
| **Customization** | Config files | Config + files | **Skills + code** |

## Philosophy: Why NanoClaw exists

OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory. Security is application-level — allowlists and pairing codes, not OS isolation.

NanoClaw takes a different approach:

**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files. The codebase is small enough that Claude Code can walk you through it and safely modify it.

**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers. They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.

**Built for one user.** This isn't a framework. It's working software that you fork and have Claude Code customize for your exact needs.

**AI-native.** No installation wizard. Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard. Ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools. Describe the problem, Claude fixes it.

**Skills over features.** Contributors don't add features to the codebase. They contribute Claude Code skills like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.

## Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| macOS or Linux | NanoClaw runs on Unix-like systems |
| Node.js 20+ | Runtime environment |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) | Setup wizard and agent orchestration |
| Docker or Apple Container | Container runtime for agent isolation |
| Anthropic API key | Claude access via Agent SDK |

For this VPS deployment guide, I'm assuming Ubuntu 24.04 with Docker.

## Installation

NanoClaw uses Claude Code for setup. There's no `npm install` or `pip install` wizard. You clone the repo and let Claude handle everything.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude
```

Then run `/setup`. Claude Code handles:

1. Installing Node.js dependencies
2. WhatsApp authentication
3. Container runtime detection and configuration
4. Service configuration
5. Initial skills setup

The setup process is interactive. Claude will ask questions and configure everything based on your answers.

<Notice type="info" title="Claude Code setup">
NanoClaw is designed around Claude Code as the configuration interface. If you haven't used Claude Code before, it's Anthropic's CLI tool that can execute commands and modify files. The `/setup` command is a skill that guides the entire installation.
</Notice>

## Container isolation

This is where NanoClaw differs from every other self-hosted bot. Agents run in containers, not in the main process.

### How it works

When you send a message to NanoClaw:

1. Message arrives via WhatsApp (Baileys library)
2. Message stored in SQLite with group context
3. Polling loop picks up the message
4. Container runner spawns an isolated container
5. Claude Agent SDK processes the message inside the container
6. Response written to IPC filesystem
7. Main process sends response back to WhatsApp

The container has no network access by default. It can only see the directories you explicitly mount. Shell commands run inside the container, so even if the agent tries something dangerous, it's contained.

### Docker configuration

On Linux, NanoClaw uses Docker for container isolation. The container runner spawns a new container for each agent invocation:

```typescript
// src/container-runner.ts (simplified)
const container = await docker.createContainer({
  Image: 'nanoclaw-agent',
  Cmd: ['node', 'agent-entrypoint.js'],
  HostConfig: {
    Binds: [`${groupDir}:/workspace:rw`],
    NetworkMode: 'none', // No network by default
  },
});
```

Each group gets its own mounted directory. The container can only see that group's files.

### Apple Container (macOS)

On macOS, you can optionally switch to Apple Container for a lighter-weight native runtime:

```
/convert-to-apple-container
```

This modifies the configuration to use Apple's container runtime instead of Docker. The isolation model is the same, but the overhead is lower on macOS.

## WhatsApp setup

NanoClaw uses WhatsApp as its primary (and currently only) channel via the Baileys library.

### Authentication

Run the setup command in Claude Code:

```
/setup
```

Claude will guide you through WhatsApp authentication. The process generates a QR code that you scan with your phone:

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Go to Settings → Linked Devices
3. Tap "Link a Device"
4. Scan the QR code shown by NanoClaw

The authentication session is stored locally. You'll stay logged in until you explicitly log out or the session expires.

### Group isolation

Each WhatsApp group gets its own context:

| Isolation | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Each group has its own memory file |
| Filesystem | Each group's files are in separate directories |
| Container | Each group runs in its own container sandbox |
| History | Conversations are not shared between groups |

The main channel (your self-chat) is special. From there, you can manage groups and tasks:

```
@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy join the Family Chat group
```

### Trigger word

By default, the bot responds to `@Andy`. Change it by telling Claude Code:

```
Change the trigger word to @Bob
```

Or run `/customize` for guided changes.

## Agent Swarms

NanoClaw is the first personal AI assistant to support Agent Swarms — teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks.

### What are Agent Swarms

Instead of one agent handling everything, you can spin up a team:

```
@Andy research the latest React patterns and have the code reviewer check if our codebase follows them
```

This might spawn:
- **Researcher agent**: Searches for latest React patterns
- **Code reviewer agent**: Analyzes your codebase against the patterns
- **Coordinator**: Synthesizes findings into a response

Each agent runs in its own container with access to the relevant tools and files.

### Configuring swarms

Agent swarms are configured through skills. Tell Claude Code what kind of team you want:

```
Create a swarm for daily news briefing with separate agents for:
- Tech news fetching
- AI news fetching  
- Summary writing
```

Claude will create the necessary skill files and configuration.

## Skills system

NanoClaw doesn't use configuration files for customization. It uses skills.

### What are skills

Skills are instructions that teach Claude Code how to transform your NanoClaw installation. They're Markdown files in `.claude/skills/`:

```
.claude/skills/
├── add-telegram/SKILL.md
├── customize/SKILL.md
├── setup/SKILL.md
└── ...
```

### Built-in skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `/setup` | Initial installation and configuration |
| `/customize` | Guided customization of behavior |
| `/add-gmail` | Add Gmail integration |
| `/add-telegram` | Add Telegram as channel (contributed) |
| `/add-slack` | Add Slack integration (contributed) |
| `/create-skill` | Meta-skill for creating new skills |

### Customizing behavior

There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:

```
Change the trigger word to @Bob
Remember to make responses shorter and more direct
Add a custom greeting when I say good morning
Store conversation summaries weekly
```

The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it. Each customization becomes part of your fork.

### Contributing skills

**Don't add features. Add skills.**

If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file that teaches Claude Code how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.

Users then run `/add-telegram` on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need.

## Scheduled tasks

NanoClaw has a built-in task scheduler for recurring jobs.

### Creating scheduled tasks

Tell the bot what you want scheduled:

```
@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am
@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift
@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing
```

The bot creates scheduled tasks that run Claude and can message you back.

### Managing tasks

From the main channel (your self-chat):

```
@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups
@Andy pause the Monday briefing task
@Andy resume the Friday git review
```

Tasks are stored in SQLite and persist across restarts.

## Memory system

Each group has its own `CLAUDE.md` file for memory:

```
groups/
├── main/
│   └── CLAUDE.md
├── family-chat/
│   └── CLAUDE.md
└── work-team/
    └── CLAUDE.md
```

The agent reads this file at the start of each conversation and can update it. Tell it to remember something and it writes to the file.

### Context files

Like other bots in this space, NanoClaw uses workspace files to shape behavior:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Per-group memory and context |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Who the agent is |
| `SOUL.md` | Core personality and values |

These are plain Markdown files that you can edit directly or have Claude modify.

## Security model

NanoClaw's security is based on OS-level isolation, not application-level checks.

### Container sandboxing

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| Network | Containers have no network by default |
| Filesystem | Only explicitly mounted directories are visible |
| Process | Container process can't access host processes |
| User | Container runs as non-root user |

Even if the agent tries to run dangerous commands, it's contained. The host system is protected.

### What you should still review

Container isolation is strong, but you should still review:

1. **What directories you mount** — Only mount directories the agent actually needs
2. **What skills you install** — Skills can modify the codebase
3. **Scheduled tasks** — Tasks run automatically with whatever permissions the agent has

See `docs/SECURITY.md` in the repo for the full security model.

## VPS deployment

For production use on a VPS, here's a complete deployment setup.

### Server requirements

| Spec | Minimum | Recommended |
|------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 1 core | 2+ cores |
| RAM | 1GB | 2GB+ |
| Storage | 10GB | 20GB+ |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 | Ubuntu 24.04 |

NanoClaw itself is lightweight. The main resource consumer is Docker for container isolation.

### Quick deployment

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP

# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
usermod -aG docker $USER

# Install Node.js 20
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
apt install -y nodejs

# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Clone NanoClaw
git clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw

# Run setup
claude
# Then type: /setup
```

### Systemd service

Create a systemd service for automatic startup:

```bash
cat > /etc/systemd/system/nanoclaw.service << 'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=NanoClaw AI Assistant
After=docker.service network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=dragos
WorkingDirectory=/home/dragos/nanoclaw
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node dist/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
Environment=NODE_ENV=production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable nanoclaw
systemctl start nanoclaw
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

The setup process will prompt for this, but you can also set it manually.

## Troubleshooting

NanoClaw is designed to be debugged through Claude Code.

### Using /debug

If something isn't working:

```
/debug
```

Claude Code will analyze the logs, check the configuration, and suggest fixes. If it finds an issue that's likely affecting other users, you can open a PR to modify the setup skill.

### Common issues

<Accordion label="Common issues" group="troubleshooting" expanded="false">

**WhatsApp not connecting**

Run `/debug` and Claude will check:
- Session file validity
- Network connectivity
- Baileys library status

You may need to re-scan the QR code if the session expired.

**Container not starting**

Check that Docker is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

If Docker is running but containers aren't spawning, check the logs:
```bash
journalctl -u nanoclaw -f
```

**Scheduled tasks not running**

From the main channel:
```
@Andy why isn't the scheduler running?
```

The agent can diagnose its own scheduler issues.

**Agent responses are slow**

Container startup adds latency. For faster responses:
- Use a smaller base image
- Enable container reuse (advanced)
- Check Docker resource limits

</Accordion>

## Architecture deep dive

For those who want to understand the codebase:

```
src/
├── index.ts           # Orchestrator: state, message loop, agent invocation
├── channels/
│   └── whatsapp.ts    # WhatsApp connection, auth, send/receive
├── ipc.ts             # IPC watcher and task processing
├── router.ts          # Message formatting and outbound routing
├── group-queue.ts     # Per-group queue with global concurrency limit
├── container-runner.ts # Spawns streaming agent containers
├── task-scheduler.ts  # Runs scheduled tasks
└── db.ts              # SQLite operations (messages, groups, sessions, state)
```

Key patterns:

- **Single process**: Everything runs in one Node.js process
- **Per-group queues**: Each group has its own message queue with concurrency control
- **IPC via filesystem**: Communication between main process and containers uses files
- **Streaming responses**: Container output streams back to WhatsApp in real-time

## NanoClaw vs ZeroClaw vs nanobot

I run all three, so here's a direct comparison:

| Aspect | NanoClaw 🐾 | ZeroClaw 🦀 | nanobot 🐍 |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Language | TypeScript | Rust | Python |
| Isolation | Containers | App-level | App-level |
| Agent SDK | Claude Agent | Custom | LiteLLM |
| Agent Swarms | Yes | No | No |
| Channels | WhatsApp | 8+ | 9 |
| Setup method | Claude Code | `cargo install` | `pip install` |
| Customization | Skills | Config + code | Config + files |
| RAM usage | ~200MB | < 5MB | ~100MB |

NanoClaw wins on isolation and agent capabilities. ZeroClaw wins on resource efficiency. nanobot wins on channel support and ease of setup.

<Accordion label="Frequently asked questions" group="faq" expanded="true">

**Why WhatsApp only?**

The author uses WhatsApp. The whole point is to fork it and run a skill to change it if you want something else. That's the design philosophy.

**Can I run this without Docker?**

No. Container isolation is core to the security model. The agent runs inside containers, not as part of the main process.

**How is this different from just running Claude Code?**

Claude Code is an interactive CLI. NanoClaw is an always-on assistant that you message from your phone. It has memory, scheduled tasks, and group context that persists across conversations.

**Can multiple people use one NanoClaw instance?**

Yes, but each person should be in a different group. Groups are isolated from each other. The main channel (self-chat) is for admin control.

**What's the cost to run NanoClaw?**

VPS: ~$5/month at Hetzner. Claude API: depends on usage. The Agent SDK uses Claude tokens, so expect $10-50/month for personal use depending on how much you interact with it.

**Can I use a different LLM?**

NanoClaw is built for Claude's Agent SDK. It doesn't support other LLMs out of the box. If you want multi-model support, look at nanobot or ZeroClaw instead.

**How do I add Telegram/Discord/Slack?**

Run the appropriate skill:
```
/add-telegram
/add-slack
/add-discord
```

These are contributed skills that teach Claude Code how to transform your installation.
