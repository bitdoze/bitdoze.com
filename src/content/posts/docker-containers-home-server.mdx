[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source platform for running applications in containers. Containers bundle your software with everything it needs to run - code, runtime, libraries, and settings - in a single package.

The container ecosystem keeps expanding. This list covers 100+ containers I've tested or researched, from established favorites to newer projects worth watching in 2026.

Why bother with Docker on a home server?

- **Install anything without breaking your system.** Each container runs isolated, so you can experiment freely.
- **Lower overhead than VMs.** Containers share the host kernel, so you get more apps running on the same hardware.
- **Easy rollbacks.** Messed something up? Just pull the previous image version.
- **Portable setups.** Moving to new hardware? Your containers come with you.

## Setting Up Your Home Server

### 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

Here's what you actually need to run multiple containers:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | High-Performance |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **CPU** | Quad-core 2.0GHz | Quad-core 2.5GHz+ | 6+ cores, 3.0GHz+ |
| **RAM** | 8GB | 16-32GB | 64GB+ (especially for LLMs) |
| **Storage** | 128GB SSD | 512GB NVMe + HDD | 1TB NVMe + multiple HDDs |
| **Network** | Gigabit Ethernet | 2.5GbE | 10GbE |

**What actually matters:**
- **CPU**: Media transcoding eats CPUs for breakfast. Get hardware acceleration (Intel QuickSync, NVIDIA) or accept slow transcodes.
- **RAM**: Most containers use 50MB-500MB. Database-heavy ones (Nextcloud, Immich) can hit 2GB+.
- **Storage**: Put your OS and databases on an SSD. Media goes on cheap HDDs.
- **Network**: Gigabit is the bare minimum for streaming 4K locally.

### 💿 Operating System & Network Considerations

**Recommended Operating Systems:**

| OS | Difficulty | Performance | Docker Support | Best For |
|---------|------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Ubuntu Server** 🟢 | Beginner | Excellent | Native | General use, beginners |
| **Debian** 🟡 | Intermediate | Excellent | Native | Stability-focused setups |
| **Proxmox VE** 🔴 | Advanced | Excellent | Via LXC/VM | Mixed virtualization needs |
| **TrueNAS Scale** 🟡 | Intermediate | Excellent | Native (Apps) | NAS-focused, ZFS storage |
| **Unraid** 🟢 | Beginner | Excellent | Native | Flexible storage, Docker-native |
| **Windows 11 Pro** 🟡 | Intermediate | Good | WSL2/Hyper-V | Windows-familiar users |
| **macOS** 🟡 | Intermediate | Good | Docker Desktop | Mac users, development |

**Network basics to sort out first:**
- Give your server a static IP (DHCP reservations work too)
- Plan which ports you'll expose - keep a spreadsheet or you'll forget
- Run Pi-hole or AdGuard Home for local DNS and ad blocking
- Don't expose anything to the internet without a reverse proxy

**Security stuff you shouldn't skip:**
- SSH keys only, no passwords
- Disable root login
- Run CrowdSec or Fail2ban
- Update regularly (or use Watchtower for containers)

### 🐳 Installing Docker

**Quick Installation Steps:**

> **Note:** Docker Compose V2 is now the standard. The `version:` top-level element in docker-compose files is no longer required and is ignored by modern Docker Compose. You'll see it in many examples for backward compatibility, but new projects can omit it.

1. **Update System Packages**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Docker & Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin -y
   ```

3. **Configure Docker (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Add user to docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   
   # Enable Docker service
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   
   # Test installation
   docker run hello-world
   ```

**After installation, do this:**
- Create custom networks to isolate container groups
- Set up your volume directories somewhere you'll remember (I use `/opt/docker/`)
- Back up your compose files to Git - you'll thank yourself later

For detailed installation instructions, see the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

**Storage tip:** Put `/var/lib/docker` on an SSD if you can. Containers pulling images and writing logs will thrash a spinning disk.

Here's a starter `docker-compose.yml` with the essential services:

```yaml
services:
  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole
    container_name: pihole
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "8080:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/New_York'
      WEBPASSWORD: 'your_secure_password'
    volumes:
      - pihole_config:/etc/pihole
      - pihole_dnsmasq:/etc/dnsmasq.d
    restart: unless-stopped

  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./homepage-config:/app/config
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    restart: unless-stopped

  dockge:

- **High-performance sync engine** (C-based daemons with chunking)

Docker image: `seafileltd/seafile-mc`

> **Performance Note:** Seafile utilizes C-based daemons and a chunking mechanism to achieve sync speeds that often saturate Gigabit and 2.5GbE links, significantly outperforming Nextcloud for large file transfers. However, it stores files in a proprietary block format, meaning the data is not directly accessible on the disk without the Seafile server.

## Best Practices for Managing Docker Containers

### Container organization

- Use meaningful container names and labels for easy identification
- Group related containers using Docker Compose
- Implement a consistent naming convention for volumes and networks
- Use Docker networks to isolate container groups

### Resource allocation

- Set memory limits for each container to prevent memory exhaustion
- Use CPU quotas to prevent a single container from monopolizing CPU resources
- Monitor resource usage and adjust limits as needed

### Security considerations

- Keep Docker and container images up to date
- Use official images from trusted sources
- Implement the principle of least privilege (run containers as non-root users when possible)
- Use secrets management for sensitive data (e.g., [Docker secrets](https://www.bitdoze.com/docker-compose-secrets/) or environment variables)
- Regularly scan your containers for vulnerabilities

### Updating and maintenance

- Set up automated updates for your containers (e.g., using Watchtower)
- Implement a backup strategy for your container data and configurations
- Regularly prune unused images, containers, and volumes to free up disk space
- Monitor container logs for errors and issues

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Network connectivity problems

1. Check container network settings and verify port mappings
2. Inspect Docker networks: `docker network ls`
3. Use `docker exec -it <container_name> ping <destination>` to test connectivity
4. Check host firewall settings

### Container conflicts

1. Check for port conflicts with `docker ps`
2. Ensure container names are unique
3. Address volume mount conflicts in your Docker Compose file
4. Use `docker network prune` to remove unused networks

### Resource constraints

1. Monitor resource usage with `docker stats`
2. Adjust memory and CPU limits in your Docker Compose file
3. Check for memory leaks over time
4. Consider upgrading hardware if resource constraints persist

## Conclusions

### Quick reference

**Start here (8 containers):**
Jellyfin, qBittorrent, Filebrowser, Homepage, CrowdSec, Pi-hole, Dockge, Beszel

**Infrastructure:**
- Dashboard: Homepage
- Containers: Dockge or Portainer
- Reverse Proxy: Caddy or Nginx Proxy Manager

**Media:**
- Server: Jellyfin or Plex
- Automation: Prowlarr, Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr
- Requests: Overseerr

**Security:**
- DNS: AdGuard Home or Pi-hole
- Remote access: Tailscale
- Passwords: Vaultwarden
- IPS: CrowdSec

**Productivity:**
- Files: Nextcloud or Seafile
- Notes: Bookstack
- Automation: n8n

### What's changed in 2026

- Local AI is practical now (Ollama + OpenWebUI)
- Tailscale has made VPN setup trivial
- CrowdSec is replacing Fail2ban
- Valkey forked from Redis after the license change
- Dockge is gaining ground on Portainer for compose-based setups

### Getting started

1. Install Dockge first - it makes managing everything else easier
2. Set up Uptime Kuma so you know when things break
3. Run Vaultwarden for your passwords
4. Add Tailscale for remote access - no port forwarding required
5. Back up your compose files to Git

The rest depends on what you actually need. Don't install everything at once - start small, add as needed. Check [toolhunt.net](https://toolhunt.net/sh/) for more self-hosted options.
