Your Mac terminal is about to transform from a bland command-line interface into a sleek, fast tool that boosts productivity. In this guide, you’ll set up **Ghostty** (a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator) and **Starship** (a fast, cross-shell prompt) to build a modern day-to-day terminal environment.

You’ll start with a clean Ghostty config, apply a Starship preset (Tokyo Night or Catppuccin Powerline), then layer on practical upgrades like **zoxide** and **eza** (the modern replacement for `ls`). You’ll also get a small “safe edit” approach for your `~/.zshrc` so you don’t accidentally duplicate init lines over time.

If you want a Ghostty-first overview (features, inspector, multiplexer vs tmux, etc.), read: **[Ghostty Terminal: A Complete Setup Guide for Modern Mac Development](/ghostty-terminal/)**.

## TL;DR: Quick setup (copy/paste)

Run these, then follow the sections below for the “why” and optional upgrades:

```bash
brew install --cask ghostty
brew install starship zoxide eza
brew install font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

Add Starship and zoxide *once* to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"
```

Pick a Starship preset:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config
starship preset tokyo-night -o ~/.config/starship.toml
# or:
# starship preset catppuccin-powerline -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```

Reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now continue for the recommended Ghostty config, safer `.zshrc` editing notes, and Starship tweaks.

## Step 1: Install Ghostty on Your Mac

To begin, install Ghostty using Homebrew, the preferred package manager for macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask ghostty
```

This command installs Ghostty into your Applications folder. If you don’t have Homebrew, set it up first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Launch Ghostty from the Applications folder or by typing `ghostty` in your current terminal. Its performance is noticeably snappy, thanks to GPU acceleration. For alternative installation methods, visit [ghostty.org/download](https://ghostty.org/download).

## Step 2: Install a Nerd Font for Enhanced Visuals

Starship’s rich prompt features rely on a font with extensive glyph support. **Meslo Nerd Font** is an excellent choice for its clarity and developer-friendly icons.

Install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

Verify the font’s installation in **Font Book** by searching for “Meslo.” For additional font options, explore [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).

## Step 3: Configure Ghostty for Optimal Appearance

Before you edit anything, make sure the config directory exists (Ghostty won’t read a file that isn’t there):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/ghostty
```

Ghostty’s configuration file allows precise control over its look and feel. Create or edit the config file:

```bash
touch ~/.config/ghostty/config
open -e ~/.config/ghostty/config
```

Add the following configuration (simple, readable defaults you can tweak later):

```
font-family = MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono
font-size = 16
background-opacity = 0.85
theme = Argonaut
```

Quick checks:

- List fonts: `ghostty +list-fonts`
- List themes: `ghostty +list-themes`

This configuration:
- Sets `MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono` as the font for clear, icon-rich rendering.
- Uses a font size of 16 for readability.
- Applies 85% background opacity for a subtle transparency effect.
- Selects the Argonaut theme for a clean, professional look. List available themes with `ghostty +list-themes` or fonts with `ghostty +list-fonts`.

Save the file and restart Ghostty to apply the changes. Your terminal should now feel polished and responsive.

## Step 4: Install Starship for a Dynamic Prompt

Starship elevates your prompt with contextual information and stunning visuals. Install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install starship
```

Integrate Starship with Zsh by adding it to your `~/.zshrc`.

Instead of blindly appending with `echo ... >>` (which can create duplicates), open your config and add the init line **once**:

```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Sanity check:

```bash
starship --version
```

This ensures Starship loads with every new Zsh session. For other shells, refer to [Starship’s installation guide](https://starship.rs/guide/#installation).

## Step 5: Apply Starship Presets for Instant Style

Starship’s presets provide ready-to-use configurations that save time while delivering professional aesthetics. We’ll explore two popular options: **Tokyo Night** and **Catppuccin Powerline**. Browse all presets at [starship.rs/presets](https://starship.rs/presets/).

### Option 1: Tokyo Night Preset

The Tokyo Night preset offers a dark, vibrant theme inspired by urban nightscapes, ideal for developers who thrive in a cyberpunk aesthetic.

Apply it with:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config
starship preset tokyo-night -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```

This creates a `starship.toml` file in `~/.config/`. Inspect it with:

```bash
open -e ~/.config/starship.toml
```

The preset includes modules for Git status, current directory, and programming language versions, styled in Tokyo Night’s signature purples and blues. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` to see the result.

### Option 2: Catppuccin Powerline Preset

For a softer, pastel-inspired look, the Catppuccin Powerline preset delivers a clean, powerline-style prompt with warm tones.

Apply it with:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config
starship preset catppuccin-powerline -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```

This overwrites the existing `starship.toml`. The preset features smooth segment transitions and a cohesive color scheme. Reload your shell with `source ~/.zshrc` to apply it.

## Step 6: Tweak Your Starship Config (recommended, minimal changes)

Presets are a great start, but a couple of small changes usually make the prompt more practical: shorter paths, optional timestamps, and command duration for slow commands.

Open the config file:

```bash
open -e ~/.config/starship.toml
```

Below are **small, safe** additions you can paste at the end of the file. They work well with both Tokyo Night and Catppuccin.

### Recommended baseline tweaks

```toml
# Keep the prompt responsive if anything external is slow
command_timeout = 1000

[directory]
truncation_length = 3
truncate_to_repo = true

[cmd_duration]
min_time = 500
format = "took [$duration]($style) "
style = "yellow bold"
```

Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Optional: show time (useful in SSH sessions)

```toml
[time]
disabled = false
format = "[$time]($style) "
time_format = "%R"
```

### Optional: show battery (laptops)

```toml
[battery]
disabled = false
```

### Optional: Git status styling

If you want clearer Git signals, keep it simple and avoid overly “busy” prompts:

```toml
[git_status]
style = "bold purple"
```

For a comprehensive list of modules and options, consult [Starship’s configuration documentation](https://starship.rs/config/).

Starship’s `starship.toml` file is your playground for tailoring the prompt to your workflow. Below are professional-grade tweaks to enhance functionality and aesthetics, building on the preset you’ve chosen.

If you prefer a more “information-dense” prompt (username/host, Node, etc.), add modules *one at a time* so you can keep the prompt fast and readable.

For example, enable Node.js only when you actually do Node work:

```toml
[nodejs]
disabled = false
```

Tip: if your prompt ever feels slow, disable modules you don’t need and keep `command_timeout` set (shown above).

## Step 7: Install zoxide for Smarter Navigation

**zoxide** is an intelligent alternative to the `cd` command, learning your most frequently used directories and enabling quick navigation with the `z` command.

Install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install zoxide
```

Add it to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, use `z` instead of `cd`. For example, `z proj` jumps to your `~/Projects` directory if it’s frequently used. Over time, zoxide prioritizes your most-visited directories, making navigation effortless. Learn more at [zoxide’s documentation](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide).

## Step 8: Install eza for Prettier Directory Listings

Note: **eza** is the modern replacement for `ls` (and what many people mean when they reference “exa” in older tutorials).

Replace the default `ls` command with **eza**, a modern tool that provides colorized, icon-rich directory listings.

Install it with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install eza
```

Add aliases to your `~/.zshrc` for a better experience (again: add these once, don’t repeatedly append them):

```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
alias ls="eza --icons"
alias ll="eza -l --icons"
alias la="eza -la --icons"
```

Reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

These aliases:
- `ls`: Lists files with icons for file types.
- `ll`: Shows a detailed list with icons.
- `la`: Includes hidden files in the detailed list.

Eza’s vibrant output makes directory navigation more intuitive. Explore its features at [eza’s website](https://eza.rocks/).

## Step 9: Create Custom Commands with Aliases

Streamline your workflow with custom aliases in your `~/.zshrc`. These shortcuts save time for common tasks.

Add the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Quick edit configuration files
alias editstarship="vim ~/.config/starship.toml"
alias editghost="vim ~/.config/ghostty/config"

# Git shortcuts
alias gs="git status"
alias ga="git add"
alias gc="git commit -m"
alias gp="git push"

# Quick directory navigation
alias dev="cd ~/Development"
alias docs="cd ~/Documents"
```

Apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

These aliases:
- Allow quick editing of Starship and Ghostty configs (`editstarship`, `editghost`).
- Simplify Git commands (`gs`, `ga`, `gc`, `gp`).
- Provide fast navigation to common directories (`dev`, `docs`).

## Step 10: Bonus Zsh Plugins for Enhanced Productivity

Boost your terminal further with **zsh-autosuggestions** and **zsh-syntax-highlighting**, which improve command input and error detection.

Install them with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Add to your `~/.zshrc` (place **syntax-highlighting near the end** of the file):

```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

Reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

- **zsh-autosuggestions**: Suggests commands based on your history, displayed in gray. Accept with the right arrow key.
- **zsh-syntax-highlighting**: Highlights valid commands in green and invalid ones in red, catching errors before execution.

For detailed setup guides, see [Enable Command Autocomplete in Zsh](https://www.bitdoze.com/enable-command-autocomplete-in-zsh/) and [Enable Syntax Highlighting in Zsh](https://www.bitdoze.com/enable-syntax-highlighting-zsh/).

## Troubleshooting: Ghostty Gotchas

**Error: `'xterm-ghostty': unknown terminal type`**

Some tools may not recognize Ghostty’s terminal type. Fix it for the current session:

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

For a “permanent” solution, it’s safer to set this **only for SSH** so you don’t accidentally change behavior locally.

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

Add:

```bash
# Some servers don't know about Ghostty's TERM entry
if [[ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ]]; then
  export TERM=xterm-256color
fi
```

Reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## FAQ

<Accordion label="Starship vs Powerlevel10k: which should you use?" group="faq">
If you want a prompt that works across multiple shells and machines with minimal fuss, Starship is a great default. If you’re all-in on Zsh and want deep Zsh-native customization, Powerlevel10k is excellent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Do you still need tmux if Ghostty has multiplexing?" group="faq">
For many local workflows, Ghostty’s built-in multiplexing is enough. If you rely on detaching/attaching remote sessions, long-running jobs on servers, or a mature ecosystem and portability, tmux still wins.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="My prompt icons look broken—what’s wrong?" group="faq">
It’s almost always the font. Make sure Ghostty is set to a Nerd Font (for example, MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono) and restart the terminal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Why do some remote servers show 'unknown terminal type'?" group="faq">
Some environments don’t ship Ghostty’s terminfo entry. Setting `TERM=xterm-256color` for SSH sessions is the simplest fix.
</Accordion>
