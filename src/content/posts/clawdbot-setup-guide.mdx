I've been running Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) on a Hetzner VPS for over a week now, connected to Slack and using GLM 4.7 with the coding plan. Recently switched to Gemini CLI with Gemini 3 Flash. Here's what I learned about setting it up and getting real value from it.


<Notice type="warning" title="Name Change: Clawdbot is now Moltbot">
Anthropic requested a name change, so Clawdbot is now **Moltbot**. The install URL changed to `molt.bot`, but all commands and docs remain the same. Throughout this article, I'll use Moltbot (Clawdbot) to help with searchability.
</Notice>

Moltbot (Clawdbot) is an open-source AI assistant that runs 24/7 on a server and talks to you through Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or Discord. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude's web interface, you don't go to it—it comes to you. It remembers conversations across sessions and can proactively message you when things need attention.

If you're new to AI coding tools, our [AI Programming Beginners Guide](https://www.bitdoze.com/ai-programming-beginners-guide/) covers the basics. For running local models, see [how to set up Ollama with Docker](https://www.bitdoze.com/ollama-docker-install/).

## What Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) Actually Does

Most AI tools answer questions when you ask them. Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) does actual work. It can clear your inbox, schedule meetings, research companies, follow up on tasks, and run automations on your computer.

The architecture looks like this:

```
You (Telegram/WhatsApp/Slack)
    ↓
Clawdbot Gateway (running on VPS)
    ↓
LLM Provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
    ↓
Tools and Skills (file access, web search, calendar, etc.)
```

The Gateway runs continuously on your server. Messages come in from your messaging app, get routed to the AI model, and the model can execute commands on your server—managing files, running scripts, browsing the web.

Everything stays on your machine except the AI inference calls. Your data doesn't go to some third-party server.

## Mac Mini vs VPS: Which One to Choose

The Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) community has created a weird situation: Mac Mini M4 units are actually getting harder to find because people are buying them specifically for Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot). Here's when each option makes sense.

### Mac Mini M4 Advantages

| Feature | Mac Mini | VPS |
|---------|----------|-----|
| iMessage support | Yes | No |
| Native macOS apps | Yes | No |
| Local model inference | Excellent (M4 chip) | Limited |
| Power consumption | ~10W idle | N/A (hosted) |
| Upfront cost | $599-1299 | $0 |
| Monthly cost | ~$3 electricity | $5-50 |
| Physical access required | Yes | No |

If you need iMessage integration, a Mac Mini is your only option. The M4 chip also runs local models well if you want to avoid API costs. But you need reliable home internet and power.

### VPS Advantages

A VPS makes more sense for most people:

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>No hardware to maintain or keep running</li>
<li>Redundant power and network</li>
<li>Can access from anywhere without port forwarding</li>
<li>Easier to set up and migrate</li>
<li>Lower entry cost—$5.49/month at Hetzner gets you started</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

I'm using a [Hetzner CX33](https://www.bitdoze.com/hetzner-cloud-review/) (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) for €5.49/month. It handles Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) comfortably with plenty of headroom for other services.

<Notice type="success" title="Get Started with Hetzner">
[Get €20 credit](https://go.bitdoze.com/hetzner) when you sign up through our referral link. That covers nearly 4 months of running Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot).
</Notice>

### When to Choose Mac Mini

- You need iMessage as your primary channel
- You want to run local models (Llama, Mistral) to avoid API costs
- You prefer hardware you physically control
- You already have a Mac Mini sitting around

### When to Choose VPS

- Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or Discord are your primary channels
- You don't want to deal with home networking
- You need 24/7 uptime without worrying about power outages
- You're okay paying for API calls

## Installation on Hetzner VPS

This takes about 20 minutes. I'm using Hetzner, but these steps work on any Ubuntu VPS.

### Create the Server

1. Go to [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/)
2. Create a new project named `clawdbot`
3. Click **Create Server**
4. Select:
   - **Location**: Germany (cheapest) or your nearest region
   - **Image**: Ubuntu 24.04
   - **Type**: CX33 (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) - €5.49/mo
   - **IPv4**: Keep enabled
5. Add your SSH key (generate one with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519` if you don't have one)
6. Name it `clawdbot` and create

Wait 30 seconds for the server to boot, then grab the IP address.

### Install Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)

SSH into your server:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

Update the system and install Node.js 22:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
apt install -y nodejs
```

Install Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) and run the onboarding wizard:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://molt.bot/install.sh | bash
clawdbot onboard --install-daemon
```

The wizard walks you through everything:
- Local vs Remote gateway selection
- Model authentication (API keys or OAuth)
- Channel setup (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Background service installation

## LLM Provider Options

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) supports multiple AI providers. Here's what works and when to use each.

### Anthropic (Claude)

The recommended option for most users. Two auth methods:

**API Key** (recommended):
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)
3. Paste it when the wizard asks

**Claude Code OAuth** (uses your subscription):
If you have Claude Pro/Max, you can use your subscription instead of paying for API credits:
```bash
claude setup-token
```
This generates a token you paste into the wizard. Works with Claude Code CLI.

### OpenAI

For GPT-5 and Codex models:
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an API key
3. Enter it during onboarding

If you have a ChatGPT Plus or Codex subscription, you can use OAuth similar to Claude Code.

### Google Gemini

I've been using Gemini 3 Flash recently. It's fast and cheap:

```bash
clawdbot configure --section models
```

For Gemini CLI OAuth setup, the wizard will prompt you to authenticate through Google.

### Local Models (Ollama)

If you want to avoid API costs entirely, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) works with [Ollama](https://www.bitdoze.com/ollama-docker-install/). Install Ollama on your server:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Then configure Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) to use local models in your config.

### Cost Comparison

| Provider | Model | Typical Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $15-50 |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.5 | $50-150 |
| OpenAI | GPT-5 | $20-70 |
| Google | Gemini 3 Flash | $10-30 |
| Local | Llama 3.2 (Ollama) | $0 (compute only) |

Costs vary wildly based on usage. Monitor your first month closely.

If you want to use your existing Claude or ChatGPT subscription with other tools, check out [VibeProxy](https://www.bitdoze.com/vibeproxy-ai-subscriptions-guide/) for routing subscription access.

## Channel Setup

### Telegram (Easiest)

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name and username for your bot
4. Copy the bot token BotFather gives you
5. Search for **@userinfobot** and send any message to get your user ID
6. Paste both into the Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) wizard

The user ID goes in `allowFrom` to restrict who can talk to your bot. Without this, anyone who finds your bot can chat with it.

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp uses QR login:

```bash
clawdbot channels login
```

Scan the QR code from WhatsApp > Settings > Linked Devices. Your personal WhatsApp number becomes the bot's number—messages you send to yourself go to Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot).

### Slack

For teams:
1. Create a Slack app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Add Bot Token Scopes: `chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, `im:history`, `im:read`, `im:write`
3. Install to your workspace
4. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token
5. Paste into Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) config

I run Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) in a dedicated Slack channel. Mention @clawdbot to interact.

### Discord

1. Create a Discord application at [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a bot user and copy the token
3. Invite the bot to your server with appropriate permissions
4. Add the token to Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) config

## Memory System

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) remembers things across conversations. The memory system has a few components:

### How Memory Works

- **Short-term**: Current conversation context
- **Long-term**: Facts about you stored in `~/clawd/MEMORY.md` and `~/clawd/USER.md`
- **Semantic search**: Finds relevant past conversations (requires OpenAI API for embeddings)

### Making Things Stick

If Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) keeps forgetting something, tell it explicitly:

> "Remember: I prefer meeting invites on Google Calendar, not Outlook."

It stores this in your memory files. You can also edit them directly:

```bash
nano ~/clawd/USER.md
```

Add your preferences, work context, project details—anything you want it to always know.

### Memory Files Location

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/clawd/USER.md` | Your personal info and preferences |
| `~/clawd/SOUL.md` | Bot personality and behavior rules |
| `~/clawd/MEMORY.md` | Long-term memories it accumulates |
| `~/clawd/AGENTS.md` | Agent configuration for specialized tasks |

## Config Files

The main config lives at `~/.clawdbot/config.json`. Key sections:

### Model Configuration

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": {
        "primary": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
        "fallback": ["google/gemini-3-flash"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Channel Settings

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_USER_ID"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Editing Config

Use the built-in configure command:

```bash
clawdbot configure --section channels
clawdbot configure --section models
```

Or edit directly and restart:

```bash
nano ~/.clawdbot/config.json
clawdbot gateway restart
```

For MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, see our [MCP Introduction for Beginners](https://www.bitdoze.com/mcp-introduction-beginners/).

## Skills

Skills are reusable workflows Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) can run. They extend what it can do beyond basic chat.

### Built-in Skills

Some capabilities work immediately:
- File management (organize folders, find files)
- Web search (requires Brave API key)
- Calendar and email (with proper authentication)
- Running scripts and commands

### Adding Skills

Browse community skills at [clawdhub.com](https://clawdhub.com/). Install with:

```bash
clawdbot skill install skill-name
```

### Creating Custom Skills

Skills are defined in `~/.clawdbot/skills/`. A skill is basically a prompt template with parameters:

```markdown
# Research Skill

Research {topic} and provide:
- 3 key findings
- Relevant sources
- Next steps
```

You can also ask Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) to create skills for you:

> "Create a skill that checks my GitHub repos for new issues every morning."

### Custom Skill Folders

Load skills from a custom location:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "paths": ["~/.clawdbot/skills", "~/my-custom-skills"]
  }
}
```

### Coding Tool Skills (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI)

One of Clawdbot's most powerful skills lets it control AI coding tools directly. If you have Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI installed on your server, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) can orchestrate them to build entire applications.

This means you can message Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) from your phone:

> "Use Claude Code to create a FastAPI app with user authentication and deploy it to my server."

And Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) will:
1. Launch Claude Code (or Codex/Gemini CLI)
2. Pass your requirements as prompts
3. Monitor the coding session
4. Report back when it's done or if it hits issues

**Setting it up:**

Make sure your coding tool CLI is installed and authenticated on the server:

```bash
# For Claude Code
claude --version
claude login

# For Gemini CLI
gemini --version

# For OpenAI Codex
codex --version
```

Then tell Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) what's available:

> "I have Claude Code installed. When I ask you to build something, use it to write the code."

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) stores this in memory and uses the appropriate tool when you request coding tasks. This effectively turns your $20/month Claude subscription into an on-demand development team you can command from Telegram.

For more on these coding tools, see our [AI coding tools comparison](https://www.bitdoze.com/ai-coading-tools/).

## Scheduled Jobs and Reminders

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) runs cron jobs for scheduled tasks. This is where it becomes more than a chatbot—it's an automation engine.

### Setting Up Reminders

Simple reminders work out of the box:

> "Remind me to check server logs every Monday at 9am."

> "In 3 hours, remind me to review the pull request."

> "Every Friday at 5pm, send me a summary of what I accomplished this week."

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) stores these and proactively messages you at the scheduled time.

### Cron-style Scheduling

For more complex schedules, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) supports cron expressions:

> "Run a disk space check every day at midnight."

> "Every 6 hours, check if my website is responding and alert me if it's down."

Behind the scenes, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) uses the server's cron system. You can view scheduled jobs:

```bash
clawdbot cron list
```

### Proactive Notifications

Unlike ChatGPT or Claude web, Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) messages you first. Set up monitoring:

> "Monitor my server's CPU usage. If it goes above 80% for more than 5 minutes, message me."

> "Watch my inbox for emails from [client]. When one arrives, summarize it and send to me immediately."

This "heartbeat" functionality runs periodic checks and surfaces relevant updates without you asking.

### Example: Daily Standup Assistant

Here's a practical automation I use:

> "Every weekday at 8:30am:
> 1. Check my calendar for today's meetings
> 2. Scan my email for urgent items
> 3. Look at my GitHub notifications
> 4. Send me a single message summarizing all of this"

One message in Telegram and I know exactly what needs attention before I open my laptop.

## Enhancing Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) with Agno and Python Scripts

Here's where things get interesting. [Agno](https://www.bitdoze.com/agno-get-start/) is an agentic Python framework for building AI agents. Combined with [uv](https://www.bitdoze.com/uv-get-start/) for fast Python package management, you can create powerful scripts that Clawdbot executes on demand.

### Why Agno + Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)?

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) handles messaging and orchestration. Agno handles complex AI workflows—multi-agent teams, RAG pipelines, tool use. Together:

- Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) receives your Telegram message
- Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) runs your Agno script
- Agno does the heavy lifting (web research, document analysis, multi-step reasoning)
- Results come back through Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)

### Setting Up the Environment

Install uv on your server (it's much faster than pip):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create a scripts directory for Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/clawd-scripts
cd ~/clawd-scripts
uv init
uv add agno openai duckduckgo-search
```

### Example: Research Agent Script

Create a research agent that Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) can invoke:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ~/clawd-scripts/research_agent.py
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = ["agno", "openai", "duckduckgo-search"]
# ///

import sys
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

def research(topic: str) -> str:
    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        instructions=[
            "You are a research assistant.",
            "Search the web for current information.",
            "Provide concise, factual summaries.",
        ],
        markdown=True,
    )
    
    response = agent.run(f"Research this topic and provide key findings: {topic}")
    return response.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    topic = " ".join(sys.argv[1:]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "AI agents"
    print(research(topic))
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/clawd-scripts/research_agent.py
```

### Connecting Scripts to Clawdbot

Tell Clawdbot about your scripts:

> "I have a Python script at ~/clawd-scripts/research_agent.py that does web research. When I ask you to research something complex, run it with uv like this: `uv run ~/clawd-scripts/research_agent.py [topic]`"

Now you can message:

> "Research the latest developments in autonomous AI agents"

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) runs your Agno script, which spawns its own AI agent to do web searches, and returns the results.

### Example: Multi-Agent Team

For complex tasks, create an Agno squad:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ~/clawd-scripts/content_team.py
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = ["agno", "openai", "duckduckgo-search"]
# ///

import sys
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

def create_content(topic: str) -> str:
    researcher = Agent(
        name="Researcher",
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
        instructions=["Research topics thoroughly", "Find current data and trends"],
    )
    
    writer = Agent(
        name="Writer", 
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        instructions=["Write clear, engaging content", "Use the research provided"],
    )
    
    # Researcher gathers info
    research = researcher.run(f"Research: {topic}")
    
    # Writer creates content based on research
    article = writer.run(
        f"Write a blog post about {topic} using this research:\n\n{research.content}"
    )
    
    return article.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    topic = " ".join(sys.argv[1:]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "AI trends"
    print(create_content(topic))
```

Message Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot):

> "Run the content team script for 'best practices for Docker security'"

For more Agno examples, check out our [Agno multi-agent guide](https://www.bitdoze.com/agno-squad/) and [Agno with MCP tools](https://www.bitdoze.com/agno-mcp-tools-context7/).

### Practical Script Ideas

Scripts you might build:

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>**Market research bot**: Agno agent that searches news, analyzes sentiment, summarizes findings</li>
<li>**Code reviewer**: Script that reads a GitHub PR and provides feedback</li>
<li>**Meeting prep**: Agent that researches attendees before a call</li>
<li>**Competitor monitor**: Daily check of competitor websites and social media</li>
<li>**Content repurposer**: Turn a blog post into social media threads</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

The pattern is always:
1. Write an Agno script for the complex task
2. Store it in your scripts directory
3. Tell Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) how to run it
4. Trigger it via message or schedule

### What Requires More Setup

These work but need custom skills or integrations:
- Full email management with auto-responses
- Trading alerts and market monitoring
- Multi-platform social media posting
- CRM integration

See our [best AI coding tools](https://www.bitdoze.com/ai-coading-tools/) article for tools that handle specific developer workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding

```bash
clawdbot status --all
clawdbot logs --follow
```

Common causes:
- Gateway not running
- API key expired or invalid
- Channel token incorrect

### Pairing Code Required

Default security requires approving new senders:

```bash
clawdbot pairing list telegram
clawdbot pairing approve telegram <code>
```

### Context Too Large

Long conversations hit token limits:

```
/compact
```

Or start fresh:

```
/new
```

### SSH Connection Issues

If SSH asks for a password when you have a key:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Need to Redo Setup

```bash
clawdbot reset
clawdbot onboard --install-daemon
```

## Security Considerations

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) runs with access to your server. A few things to keep in mind:

<ListCheck>
<ul>
<li>Use `allowFrom` to restrict who can message your bot</li>
<li>Create a separate email/GitHub for the bot if it needs account access</li>
<li>Review the sandbox settings if running on a machine with sensitive data</li>
<li>Keep API keys out of memory files and conversations</li>
<li>Monitor API usage—runaway tasks can burn through credits</li>
</ul>
</ListCheck>

The default pairing mode means unknown senders get a code instead of bot access. Don't disable this unless you understand the implications.

## What's Next

Once you have Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) running:

1. **Customize personality**: Edit `~/clawd/SOUL.md` to change how it communicates
2. **Add your context**: Fill in `~/clawd/USER.md` with your work and preferences
3. **Install useful skills**: Browse [clawdhub.com](https://clawdhub.com/)
4. **Add web search**: Get a [Brave API key](https://brave.com/search/api/) for web browsing capability
5. **Connect more tools**: GitHub, Google Drive, calendar integrations

The [official docs](https://docs.clawd.bot/) have detailed setup guides for specific integrations.

<Accordion label="Frequently Asked Questions" group="faq" expanded="true">

**Do I need technical skills to set up Clawdbot?**

Basic command line comfort helps. If you can SSH into a server and copy-paste commands, you can set it up. The wizard handles most complexity.

**How much does it cost to run?**

VPS: ~$5.50/month at Hetzner. API costs: $15-100/month depending on usage and model choice. Total: $20-110/month for most users.

**Can multiple people use one Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot)?**

Yes. Add multiple user IDs to `allowFrom`. Each person gets their own conversation context. For teams, Slack or Discord work better than individual Telegram bots.

**Does it work on Windows?**

Use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Native Windows support is untested and has compatibility issues.

**Can I run it on a Raspberry Pi?**

Yes, but it's borderline. Pi 4/5 with 4GB+ RAM works. Expect slower performance and occasional memory issues with larger conversations.

**What's the difference between stable and beta?**

Stable gets tested features. Beta gets new stuff first but may have bugs. For production use, stick with stable. To try new features: `clawdbot update --beta`

</Accordion>

Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot) isn't magic—it's a framework for running AI assistants that integrate into your existing workflow. The setup takes some effort, but having an always-available assistant that actually does things rather than just talking about them has been worth it for me.
