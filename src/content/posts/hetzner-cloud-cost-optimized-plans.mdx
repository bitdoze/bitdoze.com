## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion label="Can I upgrade from Cost-Optimized to Regular Performance?" group="faq">

Yes, you can easily scale up to Regular Performance or Dedicated plans. Hetzner allows vertical scaling with minimal downtime. However, you cannot downgrade from Regular to Cost-Optimized without creating a new server.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="What's the performance difference between CX Gen3 and CPX Gen2?" group="faq">

CX Gen3 runs on older hardware generations (formerly CX Gen1/Gen2 and CPX Gen1), while CPX Gen2 uses the latest AMD hardware. In practice, for most web applications, the performance difference is minimal (5-15%). CPU-intensive workloads may see more noticeable differences.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Are Cost-Optimized plans suitable for production?" group="faq">

Yes, for many production workloads. If your application runs at moderate CPU utilization (under 60%), Cost-Optimized plans work excellently. High-traffic or CPU-intensive production apps should consider Regular Performance or Dedicated plans.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Which datacenters offer Cost-Optimized plans?" group="faq">

Cost-Optimized plans are available in:
- **EU**: Nuremberg (Germany), Falkenstein (Germany), Helsinki (Finland)
- **Asia**: Singapore

US datacenters (Ashburn, Hillsboro) maintain the previous plan structure.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Can CX Gen3 run on Intel or AMD?" group="faq">

Yes, CX Gen3 plans can run on either Intel or AMD hardware depending on availability at provisioning time. You cannot choose the specific CPU type, but both deliver similar performance for the price point.

</Accordion>

<Accordion label="Should I choose ARM (CAX) or x86 (CX) for Docker containers?" group="faq">

For modern Docker containers with multi-architecture images, CAX ARM servers often provide better performance per euro. Most official Docker images support ARM64. Check your specific images at Docker Hub before committing.

</Accordion>

## Best Practices for Cost-Optimized Servers

<ListCheck>
- **Monitor resources actively** - Set up alerts for CPU/RAM/disk usage
- **Implement caching** - Use Redis or Memcached to reduce compute load
- **Optimize databases** - Proper indexing and query optimization matter more
- **Use CDN** - Offload static assets to reduce server load
- **Schedule intensive tasks** - Run backups and processing during low-traffic hours
- **Right-size your plan** - Don't over-provision; start small and scale up if needed
- **Leverage hourly billing** - Test different plans without long-term commitment
- **Enable backups** - 20% server cost for automated daily backups is worth it
</ListCheck>

## Conclusion: Exceptional Value for Budget-Conscious Users

Hetzner's new Cost-Optimized plans represent the best value proposition in the VPS market for 2025. At **€5.49/month** for 4 vCPU and 8GB RAM, you're getting enterprise-grade infrastructure at hobby project prices.
